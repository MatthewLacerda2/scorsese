//!
//! Not an effect a recipe chooses: a bake **must never clip**. Detuned oscillators
//! drift in and out of phase, a resonant filter can double a peak, and summed notes
//! add up — any of which can push a buffer past ±1, where 16-bit quantization turns
//! the overshoot into a click. So the last thing a bake does is limit.
//!
//! Because we render offline we can do this properly, with **lookahead**: compute
//! the gain each sample needs, then walk the track backwards so the gain is already
//! down *before* a peak arrives (a short attack ramp instead of an instant duck),
//! and forwards so it recovers no faster than the release. Both passes only ever
//! lower the gain, so the ceiling is guaranteed, and a signal that never approaches
//! it is left untouched.
