//! fx — the post-chain: delay, reverb, and the mandatory limiter
//!
//! Three effects, deliberately. [`delay`] and [`reverb`] are the two that place a
//! dry synthesized sound *somewhere* — the difference between a gunshot recorded in
//! an anechoic chamber and one fired in a corridor — and a recipe chooses them per
//! patch, applied in list order. [`limiter`] is not a choice: every bake passes
//! through it, because a clipped WAV is a broken asset, not a stylistic option.
//!
//! Distortion, chorus and the rest wait until a real sound cannot be made without
//! them (the layer's standing rule). Effects are added here, not in the patch
//! document's signal path, so the fixed source → filter → amp contract stays fixed.
