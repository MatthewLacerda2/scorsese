//! Karplus-Strong plucked string.
//!
//! The cheapest convincing physical model there is: fill a delay line one period
//! long with noise, then read it round and round, averaging neighbours as you go.
//! The noise burst is the pluck; the averaging is the string losing its high
//! harmonics first, exactly as a real one does. Guitars, basses, harps and marimbas
//! all fall out of the same eight lines.
//!
//! - `damping` scales the feedback each round trip: how long the string rings.
//! - `brightness` blends the excitation between pre-lowpassed noise (a soft, fleshy
//!   pluck) and raw white noise (a hard pick near the bridge).
//!
//! The delay line is a whole number of samples, so tuning is exact only where
//! `sample_rate / f` lands on an integer. The error is under a cent in the low
//! register and a few cents up high; a fractional-delay interpolator is the v2 fix,
//! not a v1 gate. For the same reason the string ignores pitch modulation — the
//! delay length is fixed at note start, so an LFO on `pitch` does nothing here.
