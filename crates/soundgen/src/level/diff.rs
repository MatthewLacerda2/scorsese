//! Two measurements, compared field by field.
//!
//! **This is the part with teeth.** An absolute number is hard to judge — is
//! −14 dBFS good? It depends entirely on what it is, what is under it, and what
//! the piece is for. A difference is not: "4.6 dB under the version it was meant
//! to replace" is a finding, and it is the only form in which two of the three
//! defects that argued for this whole module were ever visible.
//!
//! It is also the form an agent iterating on a score actually needs. Rewriting a
//! recipe and re-baking answers "did the change land?" only if the two bakes can
//! be put side by side; without that, the agent is left asking the author to
//! listen again, which is the round trip this exists to remove.
//!
//! Every field is a plain subtraction, `this` minus `that`. Decibels subtract to
//! decibels; band shares subtract to **percentage points**, which is a different
//! unit from a percentage and is worth saying out loud — a band going from 10%
//! to 20% is ten points and twice the energy, and only one of those two numbers
//! is the one a report should print.
