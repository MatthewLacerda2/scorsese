//! The same statistics again, a section at a time.
//!
//! A whole-file mean is the wrong shape for every problem worth finding in a
//! piece of music, because every one of them is a problem *at a particular
//! moment*: the middle section that is buried, the ending that is twice the
//! opening, the noise swell that grows until it eats the piece. All three read
//! as one unremarkable average.
//!
//! ## Where a section comes from
//!
//! **The arrangement, when there is one.** A bake of a song knows where its
//! patterns start and end, so the rows are the arrangement's own sections. That
//! is what makes a row actionable — "the second chorus is the quiet one" —
//! rather than merely true. [`Cut`] is how a caller hands those over.
//!
//! **A fixed interval otherwise**, which covers a one-shot, an imported file
//! and a rendered mixdown. [`FALLBACK_SECONDS`] is the grid.
//!
//! Either way the sections are decided *before* any samples arrive: a
//! [`Profiler`] is fed a run at a time, exactly as a [`Meter`] is, because a
//! render's mixdown is written segment by segment and never held whole.
