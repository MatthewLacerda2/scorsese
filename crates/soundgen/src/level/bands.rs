//! Where the energy sits: low, mid and high, as shares of the whole.
//!
//! Three numbers, because a number a reader can hold in their head beats a
//! curve they will skim. They are enough to say **muddy**, **thin** or
//! **balanced**, which are the failures that most reliably separate an amateur
//! mix from a competent one and which a level meter cannot see at all: a piece
//! can sit at a perfect −14 dBFS and still be unlistenable because everything
//! in it is stacked in the same octave.
//!
//! ## A filter bank, not an FFT
//!
//! Three chains run over the signal at once — a lowpass at [`LOW_HZ`], a
//! bandpass between the two crossovers, and a highpass at [`HIGH_HZ`] — each
//! accumulating a sum of squares. The three sums are then divided by their
//! total, so what comes out is three shares of one whole.
//!
//! Each chain is **two one-poles**, which is 12 dB per octave. One would have
//! been half the arithmetic and was tried first; it smears far too much to
//! support the finding this exists for. At 6 dB per octave a 440 Hz tone — an
//! ordinary vocal or guitar fundamental, squarely in the midrange — counts
//! about a quarter of its energy as *bass*, which would make a perfectly clean
//! mix read as muddy. At 12 dB it counts under a tenth.
//!
//! An FFT would be sharper still and is declined: it is a new dependency, or a
//! few hundred lines of one in a crate that deliberately has almost none, to
//! refine a number that is read as "about half the energy is down low" either
//! way. The question here is a ratio between wide regions, and a wide region
//! does not need a knife edge.
//!
//! Energy, not amplitude: the shares are built from sums of squares, the same
//! quantity the mean level is built from, so "42% low" and "mean −14 dBFS" are
//! two views of one measurement rather than two measurements that might
//! disagree.
