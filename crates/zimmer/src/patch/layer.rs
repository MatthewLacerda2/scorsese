//! Layers: more than one sound in one note.
//!
//! Most struck instruments are two things at once with **different** shapes —
//! a snare's noise crack over a pitched body, a kick's click over a falling
//! sine, a hammer over a string. A [`Layer`] is one more of those: its own
//! source, filter, amp envelope and pitch envelope, run exactly as the patch's
//! own are, and **added** to them before the patch's one fx chain.
//!
//! Still not a free graph: the sum is fixed and parallel. No layer feeds
//! another, a layer has no chain of its own, and a layer holds no layers.
//! What the layers share is the note — its pitch, velocity, timbre, glide,
//! gate and the patch's LFO — and each draws its own randomness, so two noise
//! layers are two noises rather than one played twice.
