//! Four-operator FM: the operators, and the fixed table of ways to wire them.
//!
//! [`Source::Fm2`](super::Source::Fm2) is one sine bending another, which is
//! one modulator-carrier relationship and therefore one *kind* of sound —
//! bells, electric pianos, struck metal. Four operators reach the rest of FM
//! because the wiring becomes a choice: a modulator into a modulator into a
//! carrier is a very different sound from two modulators summed into one
//! carrier, which is different again from two carrier pairs mixed. That choice
//! is what a DX7 calls an **algorithm**, and it is the parameter this module
//! exists for.
//!
//! ## Why the choices are a closed list
//!
//! [The patch doc](super) is explicit that a patch is *structured, not a free
//! graph*, because `(pitch, velocity, duration) in → buffer out` has to always
//! hold. An operator routing written as an arbitrary edge list would break
//! exactly that: a recipe could describe a cycle with no output, or a stage
//! that never settles.
//!
//! So the routings are a **table**, and a recipe picks a row of it. Every row
//! is a DAG by construction, and the construction is stronger than a check —
//! **every edge in the table runs from a lower-numbered operator to a
//! higher-numbered one**, so evaluating operators in order 1, 2, 3, 4 is
//! always enough and a cycle cannot be written down. The one loop that does
//! exist is [`Operator::feedback`], which is an operator into itself through a
//! one-sample delay, bounded in radians by the renderer.
//!
//! ## Where the table comes from
//!
//! Transcribed from Yamaha's **four-operator FM** algorithm set — the eight
//! routings of the YM2151 (OPM) and YM2612 (OPN2), the chips behind a decade
//! of arcade and Mega Drive music, and the same eight the DX21/TX81Z family
//! puts on its front panel. It is published, reimplemented many times over,
//! and ordered here as those chips order it, so a patch written against a
//! hardware diagram transcribes across.
//!
//! Two of the eight — [`Algorithm::Branch`] and [`Algorithm::Fork`] — are the
//! same shape with the operators numbered differently, and that is faithful to
//! the source rather than an oversight. On the hardware, feedback is wired to
//! operator 1 and cannot be moved, so *which* operator sits at the head of the
//! two-deep chain is a real difference. Here feedback is a field on each
//! operator, so the two rows differ only in where a recipe writes its numbers
//! — kept because a row that means what the diagram means is worth more than a
//! shorter list.
