//! vary: another take of the same one-shot, from one number (#1038).
//!
//! A one-shot's `seed` re-rolls its noise grain and where its oscillators
//! start, and nothing else: two seeds of one pop are two files and one sound
//! to the ear (the 5 ms envelopes of #1001's kit correlated at 0.96–1.00).
//! In a song a performance's `humanize` varies each hit; a single hit has no
//! performance around it. So a one-shot that asks for it is played from a
//! **scattered copy** of its patch instead: the numbers that set a struck
//! sound's character — how fast it speaks and dies, where its filter sits,
//! how far its pitch bounces — each nudged by a seeded draw, as far as the
//! amount allows.
//!
//! A draw is a multiplication by `2^(amount × reach × u)`, `u` in `-1..1`,
//! so a time of zero stays an instant and a falling bounce never turns into
//! a rising one. Each number has a **fixed slot** in the draw, so a patch
//! that gains a filter keeps the amp envelope every seed gave it before, and
//! a [layer](super::Layer) is scattered the same way on slots of its own.
//!
//! Free and deterministic like everything here: the same patch, amount and
//! seed give the same copy on every machine, and an amount of zero gives the
//! patch back untouched, which is what every recipe written before the field
//! still means.
