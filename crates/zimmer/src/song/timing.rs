//! Making a song the length the picture needs.
//!
//! A song's natural length is whatever its notes add up to, plus however long
//! the last one takes to stop ringing. That is the wrong answer for video,
//! where the music has a hole to fill: forty-three seconds between two cuts.
//! And it is the wrong answer for a game too, which is easy to miss: a game
//! jumps back to the first sample the moment the file ends, so the ring-out
//! sits at the end of every pass and stops dead under the next downbeat. A
//! loop that is seamless has to carry its own tail round to the start —
//! [`Tail::Wrap`].
//!
//! Everything here is optional, and absent means the song is as long as it is.
