//! The key a song is in: a tonic, a mode, and the arithmetic both buy.
//!
//! Every pitch in a song used to be absolute, which means the document knew
//! *which notes are played* and nothing at all about *which notes belong
//! together*. Two things follow from that, and the second is the larger one.
//!
//! **A wrong note was writable.** An agent writing a melody in D minor carries
//! the key entirely in its head, across hundreds of note objects, and a single
//! `F#` where an `F` belonged is a sour note that no validation catches and no
//! bake report measures. Written as a degree it is not a note that can be got
//! wrong: `3` in D minor is F, every time, because the document says so once.
//!
//! **A lift was not expressible.** An arrangement's `transpose` is chromatic —
//! every note by the same semitones — which moves the music to a different key
//! wholesale. That is exactly right for an octave double and it is *not* what
//! anybody means by "lift the last chorus". The gesture people mean is up a
//! step **within the key**, and it cannot even be stated until the document
//! says what the key is. See [`Key::shift`].
//!
//! ## The decisions, stated because getting one wrong is silent
//!
//! **Degrees count from one.** `1` is the tonic, `5` is the dominant, `8` is
//! the octave above the tonic. There is no zeroth degree and it is refused
//! rather than read as the tonic, because a writer who assumed zero-based
//! would otherwise get a whole part a step flat and nothing would say so.
//! Degrees past `7` keep climbing — `9` is the ninth — so a line that reaches
//! over the octave does not have to change `oct` mid-phrase.
//!
//! **`oct` places the tonic, and degrees stack upward from it.** `1` in
//! `D minor` at `oct: 4` is D4, and `7` is C5 rather than the C4 that sits
//! below it. The alternative — spelling the resulting note and putting *that*
//! in octave 4 — makes an ascending run of degrees jump back down partway
//! through, which is not what "up the scale" means anywhere. It is also the
//! rule [`Chord::oct`](super::Chord::oct) already follows for a chord's root.
//!
//! **The modes are the seven rotations of the diatonic collection**, and
//! nothing else: `major`/`ionian`, `dorian`, `phrygian`, `lydian`,
//! `mixolydian`, `minor`/`aeolian`, `locrian`. `major` and `minor` are the
//! names people actually say for two of them, and are spellings rather than
//! extra modes. The set is closed for the reason the chord table is closed —
//! a key that quietly means something other than what was written is worse
//! than the absolute notes it replaced. Harmonic and melodic minor are
//! deliberately out: they are not rotations of anything, they differ going up
//! from going down, and the raised seventh that motivates them is already
//! writable as `"#7"` — one character, against a second table with a caveat
//! attached.
//!
//! **Alterations are accidentals in front of the number** — `"b3"`, `"#4"`,
//! `"bb7"` — stacking the way they do in a note name, spelled `#` and `b`
//! only, the same narrowing [`chord::name`](super::chord::name) makes and for
//! the same reason. Without them every borrowed chord and every leading tone
//! in a minor key would be forced back to absolute names, which is most of the
//! interesting music.
//!
//! **Absolute names stay legal and unchanged**, in a song with a key as much
//! as in one without. A deliberate accidental is a real thing and has to stay
//! writable, and a document that already reads well as `"C#4"` has no reason
//! to be rewritten.
//!
//! ## Naming a chord by degree
//!
//! Not built here, and the shape it would take is worth leaving written down:
//! a [`Voicing`](super::Voicing) variant carrying a roman numeral, resolved
//! through [`Key::degree_midi`] for its root and through the existing quality
//! table for its stack. Nothing in this module would need to change for it.
