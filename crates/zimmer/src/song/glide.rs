//! Which note a glide slides from.
//!
//! Every other articulation is a property of the note it is written over.
//! [`Glide`](super::Articulation::Glide) is not: it says *this pitch is
//! arrived at*, and where from is the note before it on the same track. This
//! module is the whole of what "the note before it" means, and
//! [`render`](super::render)'s module doc argues each of the three decisions
//! in it. In short:
//!
//! - **The note that last *started*.** Time, never the order the entries
//!   happen to be written in.
//! - **Ties go to the top.** Notes starting together are one moment: each
//!   slides from whatever preceded the moment, and the line goes on from the
//!   highest of them.
//! - **A note that did not sound was still played.** Muting a track skips its
//!   notes without spending the score.
//!
//! Two types, because the question is asked at two scales. [`Slides`] is one
//! pattern, worked out once however many times the arrangement plays it;
//! [`Trail`] is the walk over the arrangement, holding where each track's hand
//! has got to so a pattern can slide in from the one before it.
//!
//! Everything here is in **written** MIDI, and turns into a played pitch only
//! at the moment it is read — an arrangement entry may transpose, and a hand
//! is where the transposed part put it.
