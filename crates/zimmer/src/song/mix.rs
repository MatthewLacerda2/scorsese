//! Where the notes are summed, and where an effect that belongs to the *mix*
//! runs rather than to one instrument.
//!
//! [`crate::patch::Patch`] carries an fx chain too, and it means something
//! different: a patch's chain is the **instrument's** — a gunshot's corridor —
//! and it is applied to every note of that instrument independently, on its way
//! into the mix. That is the right home for the sound of an *object* and the
//! wrong home for the sound of a *room*, because a room is shared. If a piece
//! can only say "reverb" per patch, then every patch in it has to spell out the
//! same settings and keep them in sync by hand; nothing in the format suggests
//! that, so nobody does it, and the result is a set of sounds sitting next to
//! each other rather than a mix.
//!
//! So there are three places a chain can live, and the order between them is
//! the whole design:
//!
//! ```text
//!   notes ─► patch fx ─► track bus ─► track fx ─► × gain × pan ─┐
//!                                                               ├─► song fx ─► limiter
//!   notes ─► patch fx ──────────────────────────► × gain × pan ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! A **track** chain runs on that instrument's whole part, before its gain
//! reaches the master: it shapes an instrument. A **song** chain runs on the
//! sum: it shapes the piece. Any other ordering would blur the two into one
//! control whose meaning depended on how many tracks happened to be playing.
//!
//! Three consequences worth stating, because each is a decision rather than an
//! accident:
//!
//! - **Song fx run before the master limiter, never after.** The limiter is the
//!   guarantee that a bake cannot clip — [`super::render`] explains why it is
//!   not optional — and an effect able to add gain after it would withdraw that
//!   promise quietly.
//! - **A bus rings out.** A chain on the sum decays *once*, across everything,
//!   and past the last note, so each buffer grows by what its chain needs the
//!   same way a note's own fx tail grows the note. [`super::shape`] still cuts
//!   that to `tail` and `fit` afterwards; nothing here decides length.
//! - **A track with no chain is not bussed at all.** Its notes are added
//!   straight into the master at its gain, which is both the cheap path and the
//!   *bit-identical* one. Summing into a bus at unity and scaling once at
//!   fold-down is algebraically the same, but `(a + b)·g` and `a·g + b·g` are
//!   not the same `f32`, and a field whose whole promise is that leaving it out
//!   changes nothing cannot afford "nothing, to within rounding". `pan` keeps
//!   that promise the same way: dead centre is a literal `1.0` per side rather
//!   than the `0.99999994` the pan law computes there.
//!
//! ## Where a part is put
//!
//! **`pan` is applied at the same moment `gain` is** — on the way into the
//! master, and never before. Both are answers to "where does this instrument
//! sit", one in level and one in position, and a track's own fx chain is the
//! instrument rather than its place in the mix: a delay that ran after the pan
//! would echo from wherever the fader had put the part, which is a delay that
//! changes character when an instrument is moved.
//!
//! The two multiply into one gain per side, so a note is walked once per
//! channel and not twice. [`crate::stereo::pan_gains`] carries the law.
//!
//! ## Keying one track from another
//!
//! A [`Fx::Compress`] on a track chain may name another track to listen to, and
//! this is the moment that can be honoured: the sum is the one place every
//! track exists separately, so it is the only place one part can be handed to
//! an effect running on a different one.
//!
//! **The part a key hands over is the instrument as played** — at unity, before
//! its own chain, its `gain` and its `pan`. Three things follow, and each is
//! the reason for the last:
//!
//! - **Turning the key track down does not stop it ducking.** A threshold is
//!   written against the part, so a duck that came unstuck the moment somebody
//!   moved a fader would be a setting nobody could keep. A kick that is felt
//!   rather than heard still presses the bass out of the way.
//! - **There is no ordering between tracks, so there is no cycle to refuse.**
//!   Two tracks keying each other is perfectly well defined here, because
//!   neither is waiting on the other's *output* — the pathological case the
//!   issue asked about simply cannot arise from this choice. Naming a track
//!   that does not exist is still refused, and so is a track keying itself,
//!   which is an ordinary compressor written the long way round.
//! - **It costs a buffer, and only where one was asked for.** A key is a third
//!   parallel copy alongside the bus and the measurement tap, kept for the
//!   tracks something actually names and for no others.
//!
//! ## Measuring on the way past
//!
//! The sum is also the one moment at which every track exists separately, so it
//! is where each one is measured. A report that says a mix is muddy without
//! saying which layer is muddying it sends its reader to change four
//! instruments at once and hope; [`crate::level::layer`] is what the rows are
//! for.
//!
//! It costs a buffer per track and a second add per note, and that is the
//! honest price rather than a free ride: a track with no chain is **not**
//! routed through a bus to get it, for exactly the rounding reason above. The
//! measurement takes a parallel copy instead of taking over the path, so the
//! samples handed out are bit-identical to the ones this mixer produced before
//! it measured anything. A song of one track skips it entirely — one row under
//! a one-line summary is the same sentence twice, so there is nothing to pay
//! for.
