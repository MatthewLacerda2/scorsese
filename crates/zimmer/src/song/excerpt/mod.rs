//! Less of a song: a stretch of it, some of its tracks, or both.
//!
//! An excerpt is **not a new sound**. It is the same renderer asked for less
//! of the same piece, and the promise it makes is exact: the samples a window
//! hands back are the samples a whole render would have put there, bit for
//! bit. That promise is the whole feature — a mix decision taken on eight bars
//! is only worth taking if those eight bars are the ones the file will have.
//!
//! ## Which clock a window counts on
//!
//! **The rendered piece, not the written arrangement.** `fit` can change both
//! the tempo and the number of passes, and `automation` already reads its
//! beats off the result rather than off the page — so a window that counted
//! the arrangement would be the one coordinate in the crate that disagreed
//! with the others. Under a `loop` fit the two genuinely differ: beat 40 of a
//! sixteen-beat arrangement looped four times is in the third pass, and that
//! is what a window asking for beat 40 gets, because it is what is audible
//! there.
//!
//! Seconds count on the same clock, and are the same window said the other
//! way: at the tempo the piece is actually rendered at.
//!
//! ## Why a window still renders what comes before it
//!
//! Everything in the signal path is causal but for two stages, and both of
//! them are the reason a window cannot simply start where it starts:
//!
//! - a note before the window rings into it, and its bus and the song's chain
//!   decay across the seam;
//! - the limiter and any compressor **look ahead**, so a peak just past the
//!   window pulls the gain down inside it.
//!
//! So a window renders the piece from the top and keeps the stretch asked
//! for, and it renders a [`guard`] past the end for the lookahead to see.
//! What it saves is every note after that guard, which for the case this
//! exists to serve — the first bars of a long bed — is nearly all of them.
//! A window at the very end of a piece saves nothing, and that is honest
//! rather than a gap: you cannot know what the last bar sounds like without
//! playing up to it.
