//! A percussion part as a step string: `"x-x-x-x-x-x-x-xX"`.
//!
//! Sixteen hi-hats used to be sixteen [`Note`]s of five fields each, and that
//! cost is only half of what was wrong with it. The other half is that a list
//! of objects with float `start` values **cannot be read as a rhythm**. A step
//! string can: the hits and the gaps are where they sound, at the size and
//! spacing they sound at, and a reader takes in a whole bar without counting
//! anything. Most of the work on a piece of music is revision, and revision
//! needs the shape to be visible — which is why trackers wrote patterns this
//! way for thirty years.
//!
//! Expansion happens **before** the performance, exactly as a [chord's
//! does](super::chord): every hit is an ordinary note by the time the renderer
//! sees it, so it takes its own ordinal and therefore its own render seed, its
//! own swing displacement and its own humanise nudge. A step string is a way of
//! *writing* notes, not a second kind of thing for the renderer to know about.
//!
//! ## Three characters, and no fourth
//!
//! `x` is a hit, `X` is an accent, `-` is a rest. Anything else is refused,
//! including the bar separators (`|`) and whitespace a tracker screen would
//! have drawn for you: **every character in the string is one step**, the count
//! is load-bearing (see the grid below), and a character that looked like a
//! step but was not would break the one property that makes the notation worth
//! having.
//!
//! ## Velocity is case, and the ratio is the writer's
//!
//! Two levels, told apart by shift. Digits (`0`–`9`) and a parallel accent
//! string are both more expressive and both cost the thing the string is for:
//! `4-4-4-4-4-4-4-49` makes the eye compare digits to find the accent where
//! `x-x-x-x-x-x-x-xX` shows it as a silhouette, and a second string underneath
//! has to be counted against the first.
//!
//! What the two levels *mean* is not a number this module chose. An accent is
//! the hardest an instrument is struck, and the format already has a name for
//! that — velocity 1, where a note's `vel` tops out. So `X` is 1 and `x` is the
//! entry's [`vel`](Steps::vel), which puts the **ratio between them in the
//! document**, written with the one number the writer already knows: `vel: 0.4`
//! is a quiet hat with a hard accent, `vel: 0.85` is a nearly even one.
//!
//! That leaves one degenerate reading, and it is [refused rather than
//! played](SynthError::AccentWithoutHeadroom): a string carrying both cases
//! while `vel` is 1 draws a distinction the entry gave it no room to make, and
//! the audio would silently not have the accents the page shows.
//!
//! A third level — a ghost note under the plain hits — is deliberately not a
//! fourth character. Ghosts are articulation rather than notation, and a
//! character whose velocity nobody could name would put a value in this crate
//! that belongs in the document. What the entry *can* say is how the whole run
//! is played, in [`articulation`](Steps::articulation): a hat part played
//! staccato, a snare run played as ghosts. A single ghost under otherwise plain
//! hits is one hand-written [`Note`] beside the string, which is the other
//! thing that field does not replace.
//!
//! ## No holds: `dur` is a field
//!
//! `x---` is a hit and three rests, never one note four steps long. The held
//! form is nicer to write and it is ambiguous in exactly the place percussion
//! lives — a drum part is mostly rests, so the reading that makes `-` a
//! continuation makes every gap in the notation mean two things. A distinct
//! hold character (`x===`) would resolve that, and it is still not here: a step
//! string is percussion notation, and a percussion hit's length is its patch's
//! decay rather than its gate. One [`dur`](Steps::dur) for every hit, defaulting
//! to the step, is what a step sequencer means by a step.
//!
//! If a real part wants one long note under a groove, that note is one
//! hand-written [`Note`] beside the string. A hold character stays purely
//! additive if a piece ever asks for one; removing it later would not be.
//!
//! ## One pitch, and no melody
//!
//! [`note`](Steps::note) is per entry, because a percussion track plays one
//! sound throughout — and it stays per entry. A step string is not the place to
//! express a melody: pitch per step would need a character per pitch, which is
//! the tracker's two-column row, and at that point the notation is no longer
//! legible as a shape and the entry is no longer a percussion part. Melody is
//! written as notes.
//!
//! ## The grid, stated twice on purpose
//!
//! [`div`](Steps::div) is the step length in beats, and the string must cover
//! the pattern **exactly** — from its `start` to the end of the slot, rests
//! included. So `div` is redundant: it could be derived from the length and the
//! slot. The redundancy *is* the check. A string one character short is the
//! error nobody sees — fifteen sixteenths read as a bar until the ear finds it
//! — and comparing the count the writer typed against the count the grid needs
//! is the only thing that catches it. Deriving `div` instead would turn that
//! typo into a silently different tempo of hi-hat.
//!
//! Covering the whole slot is the same rule seen from the other side: a figure
//! that occupies two beats of an eight-beat pattern is written with its rests,
//! so the string always shows the bar it sits in rather than a fragment whose
//! position has to be read off a `start` field.
//!
//! ## What is not here: a Euclidean generator
//!
//! `{ "hits": 5, "steps": 16 }` is elegant, it is famous, and it is **refused
//! by the point of this module**. The string exists so a rhythm can be seen; a
//! generator produces a rhythm nobody can see without running the algorithm in
//! their head, and it saves eleven characters over writing out the thing it
//! would have produced. It is the judgement `docs/recipes.md` already applies to
//! inversion and retrograde — a real operation, and the one nobody reaches for
//! by hand. If a real piece wants one, that is a request with the piece
//! attached.
