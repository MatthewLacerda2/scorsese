//! A named chord voiced other than in root position: `"inv": 1`, or
//! `"voicing": "near"`.
//!
//! Root position is the default and stays it — the parent module has why. But
//! a progression of root-position blocks moves every voice in parallel, and
//! `Dmaj7` to `Bm7` at one octave jumps all four of them a sixth. A player
//! would keep the three notes the chords share and move one. These are the two
//! ways a document says so.
//!
//! - **`inv`** rotates the chord: its lowest voice up an octave, that many
//!   times. `C` with `inv: 1` is `E G C`, with `inv: 2` is `G C E`. A
//!   slash bass stays where it is and only the voices above it turn. An
//!   inversion past the last one is root position an octave up, which is
//!   `oct`'s job, so it is refused rather than wrapped.
//! - **`near`** picks, among the chord's inversions in the octave above and
//!   below root position, the one whose voices move least from the previous
//!   chord **on the same track in the same pattern**, in document order — the
//!   oldest voice-leading rule there is. The first chord of a pattern has
//!   nothing to lead from and is voiced in root position.
//!
//! **Why only inside one pattern.** A pattern is a block the arrangement
//! places, repeats and transposes; if its first chord were voiced from
//! whatever the previous block ended on, the same pattern would sound
//! different each time it was placed, and nothing on the page would say so.
//! Inside one pattern the previous chord is on the same page, a few lines up.
//!
//! **What "least" means.** Two chords of the same size are compared voice by
//! voice, low to high, and the total distance is the sum — the textbook
//! measure. Chords of different sizes have no such pairing, so each voice is
//! measured to its nearest neighbour in the other chord, both ways round. A
//! tie goes to the inversion nearest root position, and between two equally
//! near the upward one, so the answer never depends on iteration order.
//!
//! **What `oct` still means.** It places the root-position chord, which must
//! be on the keyboard whatever is chosen; `near` only looks an octave either
//! side of it, so a progression cannot drift up or down the keyboard chord by
//! chord, and the register stays the one the writer chose.
