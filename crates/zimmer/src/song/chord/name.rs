//! What a chord name spells: a root, and the semitones stacked on it.
//!
//! The grammar is `root [quality] [/bass]` and it is **closed**. A name is
//! looked up in the table below or it is refused — nothing here infers a
//! quality from a suffix it half-recognises, and nothing falls back to a major
//! triad. That is the whole point of the module: a chord that silently means
//! something other than what was written is worse than the four notes it
//! replaced, because four wrong notes are visible in the document and a misread
//! name is not.
//!
//! **The root is spelled the way a note is, minus the octave**, with two
//! deliberate narrowings from [`parse_note`](crate::parse_note):
//!
//! - the letter must be **upper case**, so `bb` cannot be read as either
//!   "B flat" or "the flat five of B" depending on who is looking;
//! - accidentals are `#` and `b` only — `s` and `f` are legal in a note name
//!   and would collide here with `sus` and with the quality letters.
//!
//! Accidentals are consumed greedily, which is the ordinary chart reading:
//! `Bb7` is B-flat dominant seventh, and a flat five is written `C7b5`, where
//! the `b` sits after a quality rather than after the letter.
//!
//! **Elevenths and thirteenths are absent on purpose.** Both are named for a
//! tone they add and played by omitting others — a `C13` with all seven of its
//! notes is mud, and which ones to drop is a judgement. A judgement is exactly
//! what a closed table must not make on the writer's behalf, so those are the
//! chords to spell out as pitches. The same reasoning excludes `M` for major:
//! it differs from `m` by one shift key and means the opposite.
