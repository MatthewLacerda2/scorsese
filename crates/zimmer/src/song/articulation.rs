//! How a note is played, as opposed to which note it is.
//!
//! A [`Note`](super::Note) says pitch, onset, length and force. That is the
//! whole of *what* is played and none of *how*, and the gap is most audible in
//! the place a score most often sounds sequenced. A bassline is the clear case:
//! what makes one sound played rather than programmed is almost entirely
//! articulation — a slide up into the root of the bar, a ghost note between the
//! real ones, a couple of accents carrying the groove, a staccato stop where
//! the phrase breathes.
//!
//! **This is not the same thing as [`feel`](super::feel), and the difference is
//! the reason both exist.** Swing and humanise scatter a performance the player
//! did not intend — where the beat is, and how well he hit it. An articulation
//! is what he *did* intend, written on the page. They compose rather than
//! overlap, and the order they compose in is stated in
//! [`render`](super::render).
//!
//! ## Named, never numbers
//!
//! Three of these are a combination of things the engine already does:
//! velocity, gate length, the velocity-to-brightness routings a patch may carry
//! (`vel_octaves`, `vel_index`), and where the note sits against the beat. A
//! document could write those numbers itself — and then nothing would record
//! that they were an *accent*, every accent in the piece would be a slightly
//! different one, and changing what an accent means would be an edit to every
//! note carrying one. A name says what was meant, and the meaning lives in one
//! place: the table of constants below.
//!
//! **A glide is the fourth and it is different in kind.** It is not a
//! rearrangement of anything a note carries, because the pitch it starts on is
//! not a property of that note at all: it belongs to the note before it on the
//! same track. This module still owns what the *mark* means — how long the
//! slide takes — while [`super::glide`] owns the harder half, which is what
//! "the note before it" is allowed to mean.
//!
//! ## The set is closed, and it is four
//!
//! `accent`, `staccato`, `ghost`, `glide`. The test for a fifth is the one
//! `docs/recipes.md` already applies to inversion and retrograde: whether a
//! person reaches for it by hand.
//!
//! ## One articulation, not a set of them
//!
//! An entry carries at most one, so `["accent", "staccato"]` is not writable.
//! Each name here is a whole gesture rather than a modifier — a ghost is
//! already short, an accent is already full length — so a set would mostly
//! express contradictions (an accented ghost) and would need an order of
//! application between its members to mean anything. The one real combination
//! it costs is *short and hard*, and that one is a written `dur` beside an
//! `accent`, which is what the field is for.
