//! Turning a rendered song into one of the length that was asked for.
//!
//! Two steps, in this order, both after the master limiter:
//!
//! 1. **Length.** Truncate or pad the buffer to the target. A truncation is
//!    always faded over a few milliseconds — a buffer cut at an arbitrary sample
//!    ends mid-waveform, and that is a click, which is more audible than
//!    anything the fade removes.
//! 2. **Fades.** The recipe's own, over whatever length step 1 settled on.
//!
//! Fades come after limiting rather than before because a fade is a decision
//! about the level of the whole piece: limiting afterwards would drag the tail
//! back up and undo it.
//!
//! **One length step comes before the limiter instead**, and [`limit`] is
//! where it happens: a `wrap` tail sums the ring-out back onto the start, and
//! a sum can overshoot where neither of its halves did. Limiting first and
//! folding afterwards would hand out a buffer that clips — the one promise the
//! limiter exists to keep.
