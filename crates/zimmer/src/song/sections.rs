//! Where a song's sections fall in the piece it renders to.
//!
//! The arrangement already says this — it is a list of patterns, and every
//! pattern knows how many beats its slot is. All that is left is to turn beats
//! into seconds, which is the one conversion a song defers to render time.
//!
//! It matters that the rows of a report are *these* boundaries rather than an
//! arbitrary grid: "the second chorus is the quiet one" is a finding an author
//! can act on, and "seconds 24 to 32 are quiet" is a fact they then have to
//! look up. A fixed interval is the fallback for a signal whose document does
//! not say — see [`crate::level::profile`].
