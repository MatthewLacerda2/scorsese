//! Swing and humanise — a song that was played, not clocked.
//!
//! Every note in [`super::render`] lands on the sample its beat works out to,
//! at exactly the velocity written, forever. That is *correct*, and it is also
//! the loudest signal that a piece of music was generated rather than
//! performed — louder than the notes themselves, and it survives every
//! improvement made to the composition.
//!
//! Two different things fix it, and keeping them apart is the point:
//!
//! - **Swing** is a decision. The off-beat eighths sit late, by the same
//!   amount every time, because almost nothing outside classical music is
//!   played on straight eighths. It is a feel, not an error.
//! - **Humanise** is the error. Each onset a little early or late, each note a
//!   little harder or softer and a little brighter or duller, never twice the
//!   same.
//!
//! They compose in that order — swing says where the beat *is*, humanise says
//! how well the player hit it — and both are absent by default. An absent
//! field renders byte-identical bytes to a song written before either existed,
//! which is not politeness: `generated/` addresses a bake by the hash of its
//! recipe, so a global change in where notes are placed would leave the cache
//! serving stale audio under unchanged hashes.
//!
//! **Seeded, never random.** Humanisation draws from the same seeded integer
//! hash everything stochastic here draws from, at the same `(track, ordinal)`
//! coordinates the note's own render seed comes from — no `rand`, no wall
//! clock. A humanised song is as byte-identical across runs as a rigid one,
//! and re-rolling the whole performance is still one number: the song's seed.
