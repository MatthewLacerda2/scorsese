//! What a set of recipes is made of, counted.
//!
//! Every other measurement in this crate looks at **one** thing: a bake's
//! level, a section of it, a track inside it. Nothing looks at a *set*, and a
//! set is where a whole class of finding lives — six cues can each come out
//! measuring perfectly and still be one instrument played six times, which is
//! the first thing a listener notices and the one thing no per-bake number can
//! see.
//!
//! It is also the cheapest signal there is. All of it is already written down
//! in the documents: a source kind is a word in a patch, a tempo is a number in
//! a song, a register is the notes themselves. No bake, no samples, no ffmpeg
//! — this is arithmetic over JSON that was parsed anyway.
//!
//! ## It counts, and stops
//!
//! **No score, no grade, no recommendation, and no diversity number.** This
//! reports what the documents say and never what to do about it. Six variations
//! on one instrument is a legitimate thing to write on purpose, and a report
//! that tutted at it would be enforcing a taste as a build step — the same rule
//! [`crate::level`] already holds: a metric treated as an ear produces music
//! that optimises the number and gets worse. A diversity score is precisely the
//! metric that would get optimised, so there is not one.
//!
//! What that leaves is worth having on its own: an assistant that cannot hear
//! *can* count, and "karplus is the loudest track in all six" is a sentence it
//! can produce from the files without anyone listening first.
