//! # scorsese-zimmer — sound from a document
//!
//! Responsibility: turning a **recipe** — a synthesiser patch, or a song —
//! into samples. The oscillators, filters, envelopes and effects that make one
//! note; the tracker-style arrangement that makes a piece of music out of many;
//! and the WAV encoding that puts either into bytes.
//!
//! **Effects and score, and no voice.** What this crate makes is sound nobody
//! speaks: a gunshot, a footstep, a UI blip, and the music under all of them.
//! Speech is not a feature that is merely unimplemented here — it is a
//! different craft, and neither [`Patch`] nor [`Song`] has anywhere to put a
//! phoneme. A project that needs narration gets it from a provider, which is a
//! fact about the project rather than about this crate.
//!
//! This is the free half of scorsese's generated content. A `synth_audio`
//! asset costs no money, needs no key and no network, and produces the **same
//! bytes every time** — *given a fixed synthesiser*, which is a real
//! qualifier and not a hedge. A recipe is a pure function of its document, and
//! this crate is the other argument to it: change a filter here and every
//! recipe in every project renders to something new. That is what
//! [`SYNTH_VERSION`] is for, and why the address of a bake carries it
//! alongside the hash of the recipe.
//!
//! ## Boundary
//!
//! This crate performs **no I/O of any kind**: no filesystem, no network, no
//! process, no display. It takes documents and returns buffers and bytes; a
//! caller writes them. Nor does it depend on `scorsese-core` — it has never
//! heard of a project, an asset or a `ProjectPath`, and a song that names its
//! instruments by reference resolves them through a caller-supplied
//! [`PatchResolver`] rather than by opening anything itself.
//!
//! That boundary is what makes the determinism claim checkable: every output
//! is a pure function of the documents handed in.
//!
//! **Two consumers, not one.** Besides scorsese itself — `providers`, which
//! bakes recipes, and `render`, which only reads [`level`] and [`survey`] — the
//! game engine [rusty](https://github.com/MatthewLacerda2/rusty) depends on this
//! crate by git, pinned to a commit (rusty#413). So everything public here is
//! rusty's contract as well — a rename or a removal breaks it the next time it
//! moves its pin, and the change that does it says so — and [`SYNTH_VERSION`]
//! addresses rusty's bakes too. A need that comes from a game, such as a song
//! that loops without a seam, is in scope, as long as it keeps the boundary
//! above.
//!
//! ## What this publishes
//!
//! **The crate root is the way in.** [`bake_note`], [`bake_named_note`] and
//! [`bake_song`] each take a document and hand back a [`Bake`] — a finished
//! file and how it came out. [`render_note`] and [`render_song`] are the same
//! two jobs stopping one step earlier, at the samples — interleaved stereo, as
//! a file holds them — for a caller that wants to do something with them other
//! than write them down. Around those sit the
//! documents they take ([`Patch`], [`Song`], [`NoteOpts`] and the [`Glide`] it
//! may carry), the
//! [`PatchResolver`] a song's references resolve through, [`SynthError`],
//! [`SAMPLE_RATE`], [`SYNTH_VERSION`], and [`parse_note`] and [`midi_to_freq`]
//! for turning what a score writes into what the renderer plays.
//!
//! **Six modules keep their own path**, because each is a vocabulary rather
//! than a handful of names:
//!
//! - [`patch`] and [`song`] are the two recipe documents — every type a
//!   `recipes/*.json` file deserialises into. They are named for the document
//!   they belong to, and `song::Note` and `patch::Osc` say what they are in a
//!   way that thirty more names at the root would not.
//! - [`level`] is the measurement, and it is here rather than beside a caller
//!   because a render measuring its finished mix and a bake measuring what it
//!   just synthesised are the same arithmetic. `scorsese-render` imports it
//!   whole.
//! - [`survey`] is what a *set* of recipes is made of, counted from the
//!   documents without baking any of them.
//! - [`midi`] is the way in from outside and back out: a Standard MIDI File's
//!   bytes read as a [`Song`], and a song written as those bytes for a DAW.
//!   A converter rather than a renderer, which is why it keeps a path of its
//!   own instead of joining the bakes at the root.
//! - [`wav`] publishes one function, [`wav::seconds_in`], and keeps its module
//!   because the noun is what makes the verb readable.
//!
//! **Everything else is `pub(crate)`.** The oscillators, filters, envelopes,
//! effects, the seeded hash and the note-name parser are the inside of
//! [`render_note`]; the song mixer's per-track intermediate is the inside of
//! [`bake_song`]. None of it is a second way to reach a result this crate
//! already returns.
//!
//! ## The signal path
//!
//! A [`Patch`] is *structured, not a free graph*. The stages are fixed and the
//! recipe chooses what fills them — never how they connect:
//!
//! ```text
//!   source ─► filter ─► amp envelope ─► fx chain
//!      ▲         ▲            ▲
//!      └─────── LFO ──────────┘   (one target: pitch | cutoff | amp)
//! ```
//!
//! A [`Song`] layers that: tracks name patches, patterns name notes, and the
//! arrangement names patterns. Every time in a song is in **beats**, so
//! changing the tempo of a finished piece is one number.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Nothing here reads a clock or a random number generator. Every stochastic
//! element — noise, the Karplus excitation — draws from one seeded integer
//! hash, so the same recipe and seed produce identical samples in any process,
//! on any machine, on any run — *of this version of this crate*. Determinism
//! across versions is not claimed and never was: a change to a source, a
//! filter or an effect changes what every recipe renders to, deliberately.
//! [`SYNTH_VERSION`] is how that shows up outside, and bumping it is part of
//! making such a change.
//!
//! ## Rate and channels
//!
//! Everything renders at [`SAMPLE_RATE`], in stereo. Both are fixed rather
//! than chosen per call, and they are fixed for **different reasons** — which
//! is worth separating, because one argument does not carry the other.
//!
//! The **rate** is fixed because a bake is addressed by the hash of its recipe,
//! so it must not depend on what some later render happens to ask for. A rate
//! that followed the render would give one recipe many different files under
//! one hash.
//!
//! That argument says nothing about **channels**: it asks only that the count
//! be fixed, and two is as fixed as one. Two is chosen on its own terms, and
//! the terms are fidelity. A mono, centred, dry mix is not merely narrower
//! than a stereo one — it is a specific and dated sound, because everything a
//! listener hears as *produced* is width: a reverb arriving from both sides, a
//! pad spread against a centred bass, hats sitting slightly off-axis. Without
//! any of it, five instruments are five things stacked at one point rather
//! than a mix. This crate was mono until [`SYNTH_VERSION`] 3, on a simplicity
//! argument that was true and did not weigh that bill. What the width costs is
//! a second pass of arithmetic over a channel that, for every source but one,
//! is identical to the first — which is a price an offline renderer can pay,
//! and `core`'s own doc is where it is charged.
//!
//! **The samples are two `Vec<f32>`, not one `Vec<[f32; 2]>`.** The
//! alternative — interleaved frames — was the other real candidate, and it
//! loses on what this crate is mostly made of: functions that take
//! `&mut [f32]` and walk it. A filter, an envelope, a waveshaper, a delay
//! line, the polyBLEP oscillator stack: every one of them is a mono algorithm
//! with mono state, and under the split form every one of them stays written
//! exactly that way, with `Stereo::each` handing it one channel at a time. The
//! interleaved form would have made each of them either stride by two and
//! carry an array of its own state, or be wrapped in a de-interleave; the
//! first is a change to every module and the second is the split form, paid
//! for twice. The stages that genuinely need both sides at once are countable
//! — the linked limiter, the reverb's mono send, the pan — and they reach for
//! `l` and `r` by name, which reads as what it is. Interleaving then happens
//! at exactly two edges, the WAV encoder and the meter, where a whole buffer
//! was wanted anyway.
//!
//! **Where a part sits belongs to the mix; how wide a sound is may belong to
//! the instrument.** A plucked string, an FM voice — of two operators or of
//! four — and an additive series each produce a single waveform, and it
//! reaches both channels identically. Two sources are wide by nature, and
//! only those two: `noise`, whose uncorrelated second draw is free (the seeded
//! hash already takes a channel discriminator), and an oscillator whose unison
//! voices are given a `width` — copies that are already different signals,
//! fanned across the field the way every synth makes a wide pad or a supersaw
//! (#1124). Neither moves the part *off centre*: unison spreads symmetrically,
//! and a stack nobody widened is mono as it always was. Placing a part, and
//! the room around it, stay downstream, in the places a mix decision lives: a
//! track's `pan`, and the stereo reverb. There is no per-note pan and no
//! mid/side processing, for the same reason there is no node graph — that is
//! a compositing suite's craft, not an editor's.
//!
//! `scorsese-render` resamples and upmixes every audio source on the way into
//! the mix — a synthesised file takes exactly the path an imported stereo file
//! does.

/// The synthesiser's own version: the number that changes when the same
/// recipe would render to different samples.
///
/// A bake is addressed by a digest of its recipe **and** this number, so
/// bumping it is what makes every affected file miss the cache and be
/// re-rendered. Without it the address describes only the document, and a
/// project keeps serving audio its own recipe no longer describes.
///
/// It is **declared, not derived**. The tempting derivation — hash the
/// rendered output of a few probe recipes — cannot work here: every voice in
/// this crate rides on the platform's `sin`, `exp` and `powf`, which are not
/// bit-identical between a glibc box and a Mac, and a digest has no tolerance
/// to spend. A derived version would announce a synthesiser change every time
/// a project moved machine, which is the opposite of what an address is for.
///
/// So it is a number a person has to bump, and the rule is the one
/// `schema_version` already lives by: **bump it in the same change that makes
/// a recipe render differently**, and let everything break loudly.
///
/// **What "differently" means**: *any* representable recipe, not *most*
/// recipes and not an audible difference. A spurious bump costs one re-render
/// of audio that turns out identical; a missed one leaves a project serving
/// samples its recipe no longer describes — so where the two are in tension,
/// bump. What does **not** move it is a new effect, source, field or stage an

/// |---|---|
/// | 1 | The first bake. |
/// | 2 | Curved envelope segments and a pitch envelope. |

/// | 5 | `fm2`'s operators start at the note's seeded phases. |
/// | 6 | The filter modulates in octaves; its two new modes and its slope. |
/// | 7 | `fm4`'s operators start at seeded phases; a ping-pong `delay`. |
/// | 8 | A one-shot's file ends where its sound does (#970). |
/// | 9 | A `cutoff` curve moves inside a note; the compressor and limiter release in dB from a held detector; ring-outs run to −60 dB and are faded (#1123). |

/// What each branch checked, and why — the probe corpora, the cases that left
