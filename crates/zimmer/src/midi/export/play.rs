//! Playing a song through into the notes a MIDI file holds: per track, in
//! ticks, at whole keys and velocities.
//!
//! The walk is the renderer's — the arrangement in order, each pattern's
//! entries expanded to notes, each entry's transforms applied to the written
//! pattern — and stops where the renderer starts making sound. So a note
//! lands on the tick the bake puts it on, before anything about seconds.
