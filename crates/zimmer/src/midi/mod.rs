//! A Standard MIDI File, read into a [`Song`].
//!
//! The ground truth of almost any arrangement someone brings — a DAW export, a
//! keyboard take, a transcription off a sheet-music site — is a `.mid`, and
//! this is how one becomes a song recipe rather than an afternoon of scripting
//! outside scorsese. [`import`] takes the file's bytes and hands back the
//! document and a list of what it could not carry.
//!
//! **It maps structure and never guesses intent.** That is the whole design,
//! and each rule below is a case of it:
//!
//! - **One song track per MIDI track and channel** that plays a note. A piano
//!   part on one track stays one track; the importer does not split the left
//!   hand into a bass and the right into a melody, because which notes are
//!   the bass is a reading of the music, and the file did not write one.
//! - **Channel 10 is percussion**, because General MIDI reserves it: that
//!   part gets a drum voice, and its notes stay the key numbers the file wrote
//!   (`36`, `38`), because on that channel a number names a drum rather than a
//!   pitch. It is not split into a kick and a snare track either.
//! - **Patterns are a grid of bars**, [`BARS_PER_PATTERN`] to a pattern,
//!   counted from the file's own time signatures and named for the bars they
//!   hold (`bars-9-16`). No repeat is detected and no pattern is reused: the
//!   arrangement names every pattern once, in order. The `bars` module has
//!   why eight bars rather than one pattern for the whole piece.
//! - **The tempo map is the file's**: its first tempo becomes `bpm` and every
//!   later one a [jump](crate::song::TempoChange::jump), which is exactly what
//!   a MIDI tempo event is.
//! - **The key is the file's first key signature**, if it has one. Notes are
//!   written as names (`C#4`), never as degrees — a degree would claim the
//!   note belongs to the key, which is an analysis.
//! - **The sounds are placeholders.** Every pitched track plays one plain
//!   voice and every drum track one noise burst; a program change is reported,
//!   not emulated. See the `sound` module.
//!
//! What the song has no room for — the sustain pedal, pitch bends, volume and
//! pan controllers — is **counted and named** in [`Imported::left_out`] rather
//! than dropped silently, so an import that sounds drier than the file is
//! explained by the command that made it.
//!
//! **No I/O.** Parsing a byte slice is arithmetic, which is why this lives
//! beside the document it produces rather than in a crate that opens files:
//! the caller reads the file, and this never learns where it came from. The
//! parser underneath is `midly`, and nothing of it leaks out of this module —
//! its types stay inside, and [`MidiError`] says what went wrong in words.
