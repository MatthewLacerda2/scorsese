//! A [`Score`] into a [`Song`]: the half of the import that has to decide how
//! each fact in the file is written in the document.
//!
//! Every decision here is about *notation*, never about the music. A part is
//! a track, a tempo event is a jump in the map, a note is a note — each moved
//! across as the file had it. What is chosen is how it reads: bar-numbered
//! patterns, note names spelled by the key signature, a velocity to three
//! places.
