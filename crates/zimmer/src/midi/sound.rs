//! **Plain on purpose.** A MIDI file names an instrument by a program number,

//! unremarkable voice and every drum part the same short burst: enough to hear
//! that the notes are right, with nothing in them anybody would mistake for a
//! choice. Choosing the sounds is the author's first edit, and a default that
