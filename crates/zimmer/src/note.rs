//! Notes, pitch, and the per-note render options.
//!
//! A patch is *playable as a note*: `(pitch, velocity, duration) in → buffer out`.
//! This module owns the pitch half of that contract — the note **name ↔ MIDI ↔ Hz**
//! conversions — plus [`NoteOpts`], the small bundle carrying the other two (and the
//! seed every stochastic source draws from).
//!
//! Pitch is **equal temperament** anchored at A4 = 440 Hz (MIDI 69):
//! `f = 440 × 2^((midi − 69) / 12)`. MIDI is kept as `f32` throughout, so a
//! fractional note number is a legal microtonal pitch and so the LFO can bend pitch
//! in fractions of a semitone.
//!
//! Note names are the usual scientific pitch notation: a letter `A`–`G`, any
//! number of accidentals (`#`/`s` sharp, `b`/`f` flat), then the octave
//! (`C4` = middle C = MIDI 60, `C-1` = MIDI 0). Parsing lives here because a
//! song's notes reuse it.
