//! core — the note renderer: patch + note → a stereo pair of `f32` buffers.
//!
//! This is the layer's contract made executable: *(pitch, velocity, duration) in →
//! buffer out*. The signal path is fixed, which is the whole point of a structured
//! patch — the recipe picks what fills each stage, never how they connect:
//!
//! ```text
//!   source ─► filter ─► amp envelope ─┐
//!      ▲         ▲            ▲          │
//!      ├──── envelopes ───────┘          ├─► + ─► fx chain
//!      └─────── LFO ──────────┘          │
//!   (up to three layers: the same path, │
//!    each its own source and shapes) ───┘
//! ```
//!
//! **Layers** are that `source → filter → amp` path again, up to
//! [`MAX_LAYERS`](crate::patch::MAX_LAYERS) more times, summed before the one
//! fx chain ([`voice`]). They share the note — pitch, velocity, timbre, glide,
//! gate and the LFO — and each draws on its own seed. A song's `cutoff` curve
//! moves the top-level filter only.
//!
//! An envelope has three possible destinations — the amplifier always, and
//! optionally the filter cutoff and the note's own pitch. The pitch envelope is
//! the one-shot the LFO is not: a sweep that happens once and settles, which is
//! what a kick drum, a tom, an 808 and a laser zap all are. It writes into the
//! same per-sample frequency track a vibrato does, in semitones, and the two
//! **add** — so a note may fall onto its pitch and then wobble around it.
//!
//! A note's **velocity** taps that path in up to three places, not one. It
//! always scales the amp envelope; a patch may also aim it at the filter cutoff
//! (`vel_octaves`) and at the FM modulator's depth (`vel_index`), both defaulting
//! to zero. That is what separates a note that was *played* from one that was
//! turned up — striking an instrument harder moves energy into the upper
//! harmonics, and a velocity that only reaches a fader is the reason a
//! carefully written part can still sound mechanical.
//!
//! Those last two are shown a velocity of their **own**: the same number,
//! unless a performance moved this strike's tone off its level, which is what
//! [`NoteOpts::timbre`] carries. Tone and loudness are two hands, and a part
//! whose every note brightens exactly as much as it gets louder is a part
//! played with one.
//!
//! Everything is `f32` in `−1..=1` end to end; the only quantisation is the WAV
//! encoder's. The rendered buffer is **longer than the note**: the amp
//! envelope's release rings out after the gate closes, and an fx chain adds its
//! own tail (an echo cut off mid-repeat is a click, not an echo).
//!
//! **Both channels take the whole path**, from the source stage onward. For
//! every source but `noise`, and an oscillator stack whose unison was given a
//! `width`, the two are computed from identical inputs and so come out
//! bit-identical, which is arithmetic done twice for one answer — and
//! that is the price of the path being uniform. The alternative was a flag
//! saying whether the sides had parted company yet, read by every stage
//! downstream, which is a mode; this is an offline renderer and it can afford
//! the multiply instead. What it buys is that the fx chain, where a stereo
//! reverb lives, needs no special case for the one-shot that reached it dry.
//!
//! Module layout: [`osc`] (band-limited oscillator stack), [`karplus`] (plucked
//! string), [`fm`] (FM, two operators or four), [`additive`] (a stated
//! harmonic series), [`noise`] (the one seeded RNG), [`nyquist`] (what any of
//! them may place above the played pitch), [`source`] (which of those runs),
//! [`mod@env`] (ADSR), [`filter`] (state-variable filter), [`tracks`] (the
//! per-sample curves the stages walk: pitch, cutoff, tremolo), [`sweep`] (a
//! cutoff moved from outside the note), [`voice`] (one path of a note, and
//! what its layers share), [`trim`] (where
//! a baked one-shot's file ends).
