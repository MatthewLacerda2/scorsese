//! One `match` over [`Source`], the head of the fixed signal path. Each arm hands
//! off to the module that owns that algorithm; nothing here knows any DSP. Sources
//! that can follow a moving pitch take the per-sample frequency track; Karplus-Strong
//! takes only the starting frequency, because its delay-line length is fixed once the
//! string is plucked.
//!
//! **This is where mono becomes stereo, and mostly it does not.** An
//! oscillator stack, a plucked string, an FM voice — of two operators or of
//! four — and an additive series are each one waveform, so each is rendered
//! once and placed in both channels, identically, which is what makes a
//! centred part carry exactly the samples it always did. Width is a decision
//! the mix makes, downstream, and a source that invented its own would take
//! that decision away from it.
//!
//! [`noise`] is the exception and owns the reason for it.

/// little either side of the one the fader got. Only FM reads it here — its
/// `vel_index` is depth a hard strike adds to the modulator, and depth is the
/// one place a source's *own* brightness is a number the patch already
/// carries. Every other source takes its velocity further down the path, at
/// the filter and the amp envelope.
///
/// `gate` is how long the note is held. Only `fm4` reads it here, for its
/// per-operator envelopes — every other source's shaping over time either
/// belongs to the note (the amp envelope, downstream) or is measured from the
/// start of it rather than from the gate closing.
///
/// `seed` is the note's. Five of the six sources draw on it: the noise
/// source is nothing but, the Karplus excitation is a burst of it, and an
/// oscillator stack, an additive series and a two-operator FM voice each start
/// their voices somewhere in their cycle rather than all of them at zero — for
/// the stack that is per oscillator *and* per unison voice, and for `fm2` it is
/// the carrier and the modulator drawn apart from each other.
///
/// The sum is resolved here rather than inside [`fm`] so that module stays the
/// FM algorithm and nothing else: it is handed the index to use, not the
/// bookkeeping that arrived at one. `fm4` is the same rule over four
/// operators — which of them velocity reaches is a question the routing
/// answers, and [`fm_levels`] is where the two meet.
