//! trim — where a baked one-shot's file ends.
//!
//! [`super::render_note`] sizes its buffer for the **worst case**: the gate,
//! the whole release, and every effect's tail at its longest
//! ([`crate::fx::tail_seconds`]). That is right while rendering, because a
//! buffer cut short of a reverb's ring-out is a click. It is wrong as the
//! length of a file. A 0.1 s pop through a small room was baked to 1.2 s,
//! almost all of it far below anything heard (#970), and a clip placed for the
//! whole of its source blocks its track for as long as the file runs.
//!
//! So a one-shot's bake ends where its signal falls below [`FLOOR_DB`] **for
//! good**: the last frame on either channel that still reaches the floor is
//! the last frame kept. A sound that dips and swells again keeps the swell,
//! because the search runs back from the end rather than forward from the
//! start.
//!
//! ## Why trimming rather than a `tail` field
//!
//! A song has `tail` (`ring` / `exact` / `wrap`) because those are three
//! different musical answers to "how does this end", and a loop needs one of
//! them. A one-shot has one right answer, which is *when the sound does*. A
//! field whose only sensible value is its default is a knob nobody should
//! turn, and every patch already on disk gets the fix without being edited.
//!
//! ## Why relative to the peak
//!
//! The floor is measured down from the file's own loudest sample rather than
//! from full scale. A soft footstep at velocity 0.2 rings out exactly like a
//! hard one, only quieter, and an absolute floor would cut its room short
//! while leaving a loud one's alone. The mix decides how loud a clip plays;
//! the file should be the same shape either way.
//!
//! Only the bake is trimmed. A song renders its notes untrimmed and decides
//! its own length with `tail`, and [`crate::render_note`] hands a caller the
//! raw buffer, for the same reason it hands it unlimited.
