//! the oscillator stack.
//!
//! The head of a subtractive patch: up to four oscillators, each with its own wave,
//! detune, octave and gain, summed and normalized. Detuning two saws a few cents
//! apart is the entire trick behind a "fat" analog lead, so the stack is the one
//! place a patch gets width.
//!
//! Sine and triangle are generated naively — they are band-limited enough by their
//! own spectra. Saw and square are **polyBLEP** corrected: a naive ramp or step has
//! infinite harmonics, which fold back as audible inharmonic garbage above a few
//! hundred Hz. PolyBLEP subtracts a small polynomial around each discontinuity,
//! costs ~20 lines, and removes the worst of that aliasing.
//!
//! **One entry can be several oscillators.** `voices` turns an `Osc` into that
//! many copies of itself, spread evenly across `spread` cents and centred on
//! the detune it was written at — unison, and at seven voices on a saw it is
//! the supersaw. It lives on the oscillator rather than being written out as
//! separate stack entries for two reasons: it is one timbre, and spelling it
//! out costs the whole four-oscillator budget on a single sound, leaving
//! nothing for the sub-oscillator underneath it. The copies are normalised by
//! their own count, so widening an entry is a change of thickness and never of
//! level.
//!
//! Each oscillator keeps its own phase in `0..1`, advanced per sample by
//! `frequency / sample_rate`, so a per-sample frequency track (an LFO vibrato) needs
//! no special handling.
//!
//! **Where that phase starts is drawn from the note's seed, per oscillator and
//! per unison voice.**
//! Starting every one of them at zero instead is three problems wearing one
//! coat, and none of them announces itself. A detuned pair begins
//! locked, so the drift the detune exists for starts from the same instant
//! every time and the first tens of milliseconds, the part the ear identifies a
//! sound by, are a photocopy. Two hits of one patch are then literally the same
//! samples, which no struck instrument has ever managed. And notes stacked into
//! a chord reinforce and cancel at exactly the same points, which is a
//! comb-filtered chord rather than a chord.
//!
//! The draw costs nothing and takes nothing away: it is a pure function of
//! `(seed, oscillator index)` through [`crate::hash`], so one recipe still bakes
//! one file, and [`crate::song`] already hands each note in an arrangement its
//! own seed, so a repeat differs from the note it repeats without the document
//! saying a word.
//!
//! **There is deliberately no way to hard-sync it.** The case for one is a
//! percussive one-shot whose transient is its identity — a kick whose click
//! varies is worse, not better — and it does not survive contact with this
//! stack. Phase zero is not the quiet place a hard sync would want: a saw
//! starts at −1, a triangle and a square at their extremes, and only a sine
//! ever began at silence, so a drawn phase is on average *closer* to a clean
//! start than the locked one it replaces. A one-shot bake carries its own seed
//! and so is identical every time it is used regardless; the only place a
//! strike varies is inside a song, where the percussive sources — noise, and
//! the Karplus excitation — have redrawn per note since they were written. The
//! field to add, the day a patch genuinely wants a stated start, is a phase per
//! oscillator rather than a boolean, and it should arrive with that patch
//! rather than ahead of it.
