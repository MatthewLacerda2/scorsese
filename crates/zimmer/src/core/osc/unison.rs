//! unison: one written oscillator, several sounding ones.
//!
//! Detuning copies of a wave against each other is the oldest trick in
//! subtractive synthesis and the whole of the supersaw. What this module owns
//! is the three numbers that turn `voices` into that: where each copy sits in
//! pitch, what each one weighs, and where in its cycle each one begins.
//!
//! All three have to be per **voice** or the feature is not unison. Copies at
//! one pitch are one oscillator; copies at one gain are that oscillator turned
//! up; and copies at one phase are that oscillator turned up for the first few
//! tens of milliseconds, which is exactly the stretch the ear identifies a
//! sound by.
