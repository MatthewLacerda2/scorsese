//! the additive series: a spectrum stated rather than carved.
//!
//! Every other head of the signal path *shapes*. [`osc`](super::osc) generates
//! something rich and hands it to a filter to carve down;
//! [`karplus`](super::karplus) excites a string and lets it ring;
//! [`fm`](super::fm) bends one sine with another and takes whatever sidebands
//! come out. This one says what the spectrum is: a table of partials, each
//! with a place, a weight and a fade, summed into one tone. A drawbar organ is
//! the literal case — the drawbars *are* the gains — and bowed and blown
//! sustains, glass and struck metal are the same idea with the partials
//! somewhere else.
//!
//! ## The two envelopes, and how they meet
//!
//! **A partial's `decay` and the patch's amp envelope multiply, and the
//! shorter of the two always wins.** This is the part of the source that is
//! easiest to get wrong, so it is stated rather than implied.
//!
//! The series is rendered at the head of the signal path, so what leaves this
//! module is already shaped: each partial has been scaled by
//! `exp(−t / decay)` before the filter, the amp envelope or anything else sees
//! it. The amp envelope then multiplies that whole sum. Two consequences
//! follow and neither is negotiable:
//!
//! - **The amp envelope cannot bring a partial back.** A partial whose own
//!   decay has taken it to nothing is gone for the rest of the note, however
//!   the envelope moves afterwards. That is the point — it is what makes a
//!   note brighten at its attack and settle into its body.
//! - **A partial's decay cannot outlast the note.** The amp envelope's release
//!   closes over everything, so a fundamental with a ten-second decay under an
//!   envelope that releases in 50 ms is a 50 ms note.
//!
//! So the two are doing different jobs, and a patch that gives them the same
//! job hears the note die twice: a percussive amp envelope over percussive
//! partial decays lands somewhere much shorter and duller than either was
//! written for. The shape to reach for is an amp envelope that **sustains** —
//! `{ "a": 0.01, "d": 0.0, "s": 1.0, "r": 0.2 }` — with the partial decays
//! carrying the movement, which is what an organ, a bowed string and a struck
//! bar all want.
//!
//! `decay` is measured from the **start of the note**, not from the gate
//! closing, exactly as [`fm`](super::fm)'s `mod_decay` is. A partial does not
//! know how long the key is held; it is a property of the tone.
//!
//! ## Partials above Nyquist are dropped, never folded
//!
//! A sixteenth partial of a note at 2 kHz sits at 32 kHz, which no 44.1 kHz
//! buffer can hold: it would fold back down to 12 kHz as inharmonic garbage
//! sitting inside the audible band. This is the problem polyBLEP solves for a
//! naive saw, and here the fix is simply not to render it.
//!
//! The decision is made **once per note** and against the *highest* frequency
//! the pitch track reaches — a partial is either in the note or out of it,
//! never switched off part-way through by a vibrato, which would be an audible
//! click at each crossing. It is per note rather than per patch because which
//! partials are legal depends on the pitch played: the same organ is a full
//! sixteen partials in the bass and a handful at the top of the keyboard,
//! which is also what a real one does.
//!
//! ## Normalised by the gain that sounds
//!
//! The sum is divided by the total gain of the partials that **actually
//! render**, so adding a partial thickens the tone without making it louder —
//! the rule [`osc`](super::osc) already follows for a stack. It also bounds
//! the output: with every partial's normalised gain summing to one, the worst
//! case is every one of them peaking together at exactly ±1.
//!
//! Dropped partials are left out of that total on purpose. Normalising against
//! the *declared* gains instead would make a note quieter the higher it is
//! played, purely because more of its series had fallen off the top — a source
//! whose level tracked the register would fight every gain decision the mix
//! makes, and a note high enough to be a lone fundamental would arrive as a
//! whisper rather than as a sine.
//!
//! ## Where each partial starts in its cycle
//!
//! Drawn from the note's seed, per partial, for the three reasons
//! [`osc`](super::osc)'s module doc sets out at length — and one more that is
//! specific here: partials all starting at phase zero peak together at the
//! first sample and nowhere else, which is a buzz with a click on it rather
//! than a tone. The draw costs nothing and takes nothing away, since it is a
//! pure function of `(seed, partial index)`, and the index is the partial's
//! place in the *declared* list, so dropping one at Nyquist does not move the
//! others.
//!
//! ## What it costs
//!
//! Sixteen partials is sixteen sine oscillators per note, which is more
//! arithmetic than anything else in this crate. Measured on the machine this
//! is developed on (Ryzen 5 3400G, `--release`), one second of a sixteen-partial
//! note — 44 100 samples — renders in **about 4 ms**, against about 0.4 ms for
//! a single-oscillator saw stack. A note with decays on every partial costs
//! about 8 ms, the difference being one `exp` per partial per sample.
//!
//! Four milliseconds per second of audio is a real-time factor of roughly 250×.
//! `song/render.rs` already rests the voice allocator on the same argument and
//! it holds here: this is not a real-time synth, it is a buffer being built,
//! and a minute-long piece scored thickly on this source spends under a second
//! of its bake inside this module.
