//! The per-sample curves a note follows: pitch, cutoff, and the tremolo gain.
//!
//! One note is a buffer, and three of the things that shape it are decided
//! *per sample* rather than once: what frequency the source runs at, where the
//! filter sits, and how the level is dipped. Each is a `Vec<f32>` (or, for the
//! tremolo, a value read at an index) worked out before the stage that walks
//! it, which is what lets a filter stay a mono algorithm with mono state while
//! the curve it follows belongs to the note.
//!
//! **The rule they share is that sources of movement add.** A vibrato, a pitch
//! envelope and a glide are three terms of one sum in semitones; a filter
//! envelope, a velocity routing and a cutoff LFO are three terms of one sum in
//! octaves. Each is then applied *once*, as an exponent — so a zero term is
//! harmless, and no two of them can disagree about which applies first.
