//! the Chamberlin state-variable filter.
//!
//! The filter is what makes a subtractive patch expressive: a raw saw stack is a
//! buzz until an envelope sweeps a resonant cutoff across it. We use the
//! **Chamberlin SVF** — two integrators in a loop yielding lowpass, highpass and
//! bandpass from one topology, with an honest resonance knob — because it is stable
//! at audio rates, costs a handful of adds per sample, and takes a *new cutoff every
//! sample* for free (which is exactly what an envelope sweep and an LFO wobble need).
//! Only lowpass and highpass are exposed in v1.
//!
//! The classic caveat is that the plain form goes unstable as the cutoff approaches
//! a quarter of the sample rate. We run it **2× oversampled** (two half-steps per
//! output sample), which pushes the stable ceiling up to ~`sr/3`, and clamp the
//! cutoff there — so a "fully open" filter really is open across the audible band.
