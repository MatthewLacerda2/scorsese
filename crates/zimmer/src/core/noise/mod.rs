//! the one source of randomness in a bake.
//!
//! Every stochastic element in the synth — the `noise` source, the Karplus-Strong
//! excitation — draws from here, and here draws from the **seeded integer hash**
//! `procgen` established ([`crate::hash`]). No `rand`, no wall clock: the
//! sample at index `i` is a pure function of `(i, channel, seed)`, which is what
//! makes "same patch + note + seed ⇒ byte-identical WAV" true rather than hoped for.
//!
//! What the draw is *shaped* into is [`color`]'s business: white is the draw
//! itself, and pink and brown are that draw through a filter whose slope is
//! the colour. That module owns the measurements and the reasoning; this one
//! owns the draw and the two channels.
