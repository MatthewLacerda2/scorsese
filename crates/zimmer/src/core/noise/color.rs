//! the colour of noise: how a draw's energy is spread across the spectrum.
//!
//! White noise carries equal energy per **hertz**, so half of it sits in the
//! top octave and nearly all of it above 1 kHz — which is why it is a *hiss*
//! and why almost nothing in the physical world is white. Wind, surf, rain,
//! room tone, the body of a snare and the low half of an impact all fall away
//! with frequency, and the two slopes worth naming are −3 dB per octave
//! (**pink**, equal energy per octave) and −6 (**brown**, an integrated white
//! draw).
//!
//! A lowpass over white is not a substitute and that is the whole reason this
//! module exists: a filter changes the slope only *at its cutoff* and leaves
//! everything below it flat, so what comes out is a hiss with the top taken
//! off rather than a different colour. Measured over the octave centres from
//! 62.5 Hz to 8 kHz, a single one-pole over white fits −2.4 to −5.9 dB per
//! octave depending on where the cutoff is put, and it misses that fit by as
//! much as **3.9 dB** band to band — it is never a straight line, which is the
//! one thing a colour is.
//!
//! ## Pink is a bank of one-poles, and it was measured before it was chosen
//!
//! Three of them, Paul Kellett's economical pinking filter: the poles are
//! staggered about three octaves apart so that each one's −6 dB skirt is
//! handed over to the next before it can get steep, and the sum of the three
//! is a −3 dB line. Measured against the same probe as above: **−3.00 dB per
//! octave with 1.1 dB of ripple** across ten octaves from 31 Hz to 16 kHz, and
//! −2.98 with 0.56 dB of ripple over the seven octaves from 125 Hz up, where
//! the ear actually is.
//!
//! Two more elaborate generators were built and measured beside it, because
//! reaching for one before knowing the simple thing had failed is how a crate
//! this size grows a DSP department. Kellett's seven-term refinement fits
//! −3.00 with 0.67 dB of ripple, and **Voss-McCartney** — a binary tree of
//! independently redrawn rows — fits −2.97 with 0.67. Neither is audibly
//! straighter than a ripple already inside a decibel, both carry more state,
//! and Voss needs a second draw stream of its own. Three poles it is.
//!
//! ## Brown is a leaky integrator, and the leak is the whole design
//!
//! Summing white noise integrates it, which is exactly the −6 dB per octave
//! wanted. Summing it *without a leak* is a random walk: its excursion grows
//! without bound as the note gets longer, so it wanders off centre, and the DC
//! it wanders to eats the headroom of everything downstream while making no
//! sound at all. Measured over one draw: an unleaky integrator peaks at 105
//! after 16 thousand samples and at **493** after a million, and its mean sits
//! 15 away from silence. With the leak it peaks at 22.7 and 24.0 over the same
//! two lengths — bounded, and stationary, which is what makes it a *sound*
//! rather than a slow ramp.
//!
//! [`BROWN_LEAK`] puts the pole at about 35 Hz, below the bottom of anything a
//! recipe is writing for, and buys −5.89 dB per octave with 0.37 dB of ripple
//! from 125 Hz up. Leaking less measures marginally straighter and drifts
//! visibly more; leaking more flattens the slope to −5.5.
//!
//! ## Every colour arrives at the same level
//!
//! Each is scaled so its RMS matches white's, which is the measurable stand-in
//! for *the same volume* and means changing a recipe's colour changes its
//! character and not its fader.
//!
//! **It cannot be literal loudness matching**, and it is worth saying why
//! rather than letting a reader assume it is. The ear weights the top octaves
//! far above the bottom, so brown at equal RMS is heard well over a dozen
//! decibels quieter than white, and matching *that* would ask for more level
//! than a signal can carry. Equal RMS is the closest honest target.
//!
//! What it costs is the **crest factor**. White here is a uniform draw and
//! peaks at exactly 1.0; pink and brown are sums of many draws and so are
//! Gaussian-ish, and over a two-second note they measure 2.4 and 2.1 at the
//! same RMS. That is what noise of those colours is, the peak is not a defect
//! to be clipped out of it, and the master limiter every bake passes through
//! is where this crate has always answered for peaks.
//!
//! Measured end to end, off a rendered note rather than off the filter: white
//! −0.05 dB per octave, pink −3.06, brown −5.97, at 0.07 and 0.15 dB from
//! white's level. `zimmer/tests/patch/noise.rs` is where those are asserted.
