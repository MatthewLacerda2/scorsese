//! What each refusal says out loud.
//!
//! Here rather than beside its variant because [`SynthError`] does not fit in
//! one file under the size gate, and a message is the half that can leave:
//! nothing matches on one, so moving it costs no caller anything. The groups
//! and the order are [the enum's](super), one arm per variant.
//!
//! **The match is exhaustive**, which is what makes keeping the two apart
//! safe: a variant added next door and left without words here does not
//! compile, and the error names it.
//!
//! **Five small groups are worded apart**: a square's pulse width in
//! [`pulse`], where notes and echoes land against the beat in [`timing`], the
//! curves that move a value across a piece in [`automation`], and **two more
//! in [`length`] and [`source`]**: the refusals of `fit`, `fade`, `tail` and
//! `anchors`, split off when this file reached the size gate, and the two
//! about how long a single note lasts, which joined them for the same reason;
//! and a patch's sources and layers, split off when it reached the gate
//! again. The
//! match here still names each of them, in the one arm that hands them over,
//! so a new variant still does not compile until it has a home. What the
//! compiler cannot check is that `length`'s and `source`'s matches have an arm
//! for every name in their lists — which is why each list is short and the
//! words sit right beside it, rather than a whole group of thirty being moved.
