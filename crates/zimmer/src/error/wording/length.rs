//! What a note's length, and a song's length and level fields, are refused
//! with: `duration`, a note too long to render, `fit`, `fade`, `tail` and
//! `anchors`.
//!
//! Out of [`super`] because that file is at the size gate, and this is the
//! seam that group already had — the fields [`crate::song`] validates
//! together, because each is a property of the whole piece rather than of a
//! note in it. A single note's own length joined them later, by the same
//! argument about the parent's size. The parent's match hands every one of these variants here by
//! name, so a variant can only reach the catch-all arm below if it was added
//! to that list and not to this match — and then it prints its `Debug` form
//! rather than panicking inside a `Display`, which the first test to print it
//! finds.
