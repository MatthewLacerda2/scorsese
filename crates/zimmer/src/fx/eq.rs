//! Filter bands, from the RBJ cookbook.
//!
//! Robert Bristow-Johnson's **Audio EQ Cookbook** is the public-domain page
//! every equaliser at this scale is built from: closed-form second-order
//! coefficients for a low-pass, a high-pass, a peaking bell and a shelf at
//! either end, derived from an analog prototype and bilinear-transformed. Six
//! lines of arithmetic per band, no tuning tables to invent, and the same
//! formulas are inside more or less every plugin anyone has ever mixed
//! through — the "standard, proven algorithm" bar this layer is held to, the
//! way [`super::reverb`] is held to Freeverb.
//!
//! ## Why a biquad and not the SVF already in the crate
//!
//! [`crate::core::filter`] is a Chamberlin state-variable filter, and it is
//! there for a property this does not need: it takes a **new cutoff every
//! sample** for free, which is what an envelope sweep and an LFO wobble are
//! made of. It pays for that with a response that is only approximately what
//! its cutoff says, and it has no shelving or peaking form at all.
//!
//! An EQ band is the opposite case. It is *static* — set once for the whole
//! signal — so the coefficients are computed once and the per-sample cost is
//! five multiplies. What matters instead is that the curve is exactly the one
//! asked for: a flat pass band, a cut of exactly the decibels written, and no
//! surprise resonance at the corner. That is the biquad's whole reason to
//! exist, and it is why a mixing move belongs in one and an instrument's
//! filter sweep does not.
//!
//! ## Zero gain is a bypass, and it is exact
//!
//! A peaking band at `0.0` dB is mathematically the identity, but running the
//! difference equation for it is not: the coefficients round, and a signal
//! comes back a few ulps away from where it went in. So a band whose kind
//! reads a gain and whose gain is zero is **skipped entirely** rather than
//! computed. That is the difference between a recipe that can list its bands
//! and sweep one of them, and a recipe where every parked band quietly
//! colours the mix.
//!
//! ## No tail
//!
//! [`super::tail_seconds`] gets nothing from an EQ, the way it gets nothing
//! from [`super::saturate`]. A biquad does have memory, so this is a claim
//! rather than a definition — but its ring-down is bounded by roughly
//! `Q / (π · f)`, which at the extremes this clamps to ([`MAX_Q`] at
//! [`MIN_HZ`]) is a few hundred milliseconds and at any band anyone would
//! write is under ten. More to the point it decays *with* the signal rather
//! than after it: an EQ neither delays nor repeats anything, so there is no
//! echo to cut off mid-repeat, which is what the tail exists to protect.
//! Padding every note for it would grow every recipe using an EQ for nothing.
