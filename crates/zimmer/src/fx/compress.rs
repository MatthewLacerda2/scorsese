//! the compressor a recipe chooses — and the one effect here that can be
//! listening to something other than the signal it changes.
//!
//! ## Not the limiter at a different setting
//!
//! [`super::limiter`] is a **safety device**. It is not listed among the
//! effects at all, every bake goes through it whether the recipe asked or not,
//! and a signal that never approaches the ceiling comes back untouched — its
//! whole job is that a file cannot clip. A compressor is a **musical device**:
//! it is chosen, it is meant to be audible, and it decides how a part sits.
//! The two share the shape of their implementation and nothing else.
//!
//! What it buys is **crest factor** — the distance between a signal's peaks
//! and its body. A mix with nothing compressing anywhere has peaks towering
//! over its average: it measures loud, sounds quiet, and reads as several
//! parts summed rather than as one performance. Pulling the peaks down and
//! handing the difference back as `makeup` is what closes that gap, and a
//! gentle one over the sum is most of what the word *glue* means.
//!
//! ## Offline, so the attack is free
//!
//! The trick [`super::limiter`]'s doc already argues for: this crate renders a
//! whole buffer rather than streaming it, so the gain every sample needs can
//! be worked out first and *then* ramped. Two passes over that gain track —
//! backwards, so it is already down before a peak arrives, and forwards, so it
//! recovers no faster than the release — and both may only ever lower it.
//!
//! That is a transparent attack rather than a click followed by an overshoot,
//! and it is the one place this behaves unlike a hardware compressor: the duck
//! is *centred on* the transient instead of chasing it, so a slow attack here
//! does not let the transient through the way a streaming compressor's does.
//! `mix` is how a recipe keeps one — a hard-compressed copy under an untouched
//! one is parallel, or "New York", compression, and it is the safest way to
//! add density without flattening what made the part interesting.
//!
//! ## The detector is linked, and it may be listening elsewhere
//!
//! One gain track, taken from whichever channel is louder at each frame and
//! applied to both, for exactly the reason the limiter gives: an unlinked
//! compressor is a fader that moves one side and not the other every time it
//! acts, and a centred part drifts away from whichever side happened to be
//! loud.
//!
//! *Where* the level is read is the other half. Normally it is the signal
//! being changed. With a sidechain it is another track's part, and what comes
//! out is the most recognisable production move of the last twenty years: a
//! kick pressing the pad and the bass down on every beat, so the low end is
//! taken in turns rather than fought over. [`crate::song`]'s mixer decides
//! which part is handed over and says why; this module only ever reads the one
//! it is given.
