//! Who the copies are: how many, where each one's sweep starts, how fast it
//! runs, and where in the field it sits.
//!
//! Split out from the effect itself because it answers a different question.
//! [`super`] is *what a modulated delay does to a signal*; this is *what the
//! ensemble is made of*, and it is the half that has to be deterministic —
//! every number here comes from the seeded hash, none of it from the audio.
//!
//! ## Stratified, not uniform
//!
//! Voice `v` takes its phase offset from inside the `v`-th slice of the cycle,
//! rather than from a draw over the whole of it. A uniform draw over four
//! voices will sometimes put two of them within a few degrees of each other,
//! and two voices in phase are not two voices — they are one voice 6 dB
//! louder, which is the exact failure a chorus exists to avoid. Stratifying
//! makes that unrepresentable instead of unlikely.
//!
//! ## The field, and what fills it
//!
//! The voices are placed evenly from one edge to the other with both ends
//! occupied, and each side's gains are then normalised to sum to one. Two
//! consequences worth stating, because both read the other way round:
//!
//! - **A voice count is not a fader.** The normalisation means the wet signal
//!   arrives at the level of the dry it is blended against, however many
//!   copies there are.
//! - **A voice count is not a width control either.** The width is carried by
//!   the outermost pair, so two panned hard is the widest an ensemble gets and
//!   four is the thickest — the ones between fill the field in rather than
//!   stretching it. More copies is more disagreement in the middle, which is
//!   what a section is.
