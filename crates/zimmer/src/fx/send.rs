//! A chain run beside a **send**: the whole mix, and the part of it that
//! reaches the room.
//!
//! A song's chain is one chain over the sum, and most of it means the same
//! thing to every track — glue, a shelf, a little drive. The room does not: a
//! kick and a bass want to stay dry while the pad over them rings, all in one
//! space. So the song's chain is run over **two** signals carried side by
//! side, the mix itself and the *sent* mix (each track at its `send`), and the
//! only stages that tell them apart are [`super::reverb`] and [`super::delay`]:
//! their dry side is the mix's and their tail is the sent mix's.
//!
//! Everything else runs on both, so the sent mix stays the same piece of music
//! as the mix it was taken from — an EQ before the reverb shapes what reaches
//! the room as well as what does not. Two choices make that hold:
//!
//! - **The room's own output is sent onward in full.** After a reverb the sent
//!   mix carries the tail too, so a delay further down the chain echoes the
//!   room, and a dry kick stays dry through both.
//! - **A compressor reads its level from the mix and applies the same gain to
//!   the sent mix.** Compressing the sent mix on its own level would duck it by
//!   a different amount than the signal it is a part of, and the room would
//!   pump against the music.
//!
//! The one stage that is honestly approximate is a `saturate` **before** a
//! room: drive is not linear, so the sent mix driven alone is not the sent
//! share of the mix driven whole. It is close, it is the obvious meaning, and
//! drive belongs after the room more often than before it.
//!
//! When every track sends everything, the sent mix *is* the mix, sample for
//! sample, at every stage — so this produces the samples [`super::apply_chain`]
//! does. The mixer still takes the plain path then, because it is half the
//! work; that it would agree is what makes a send of `1.0` mean "as before".
