//! soft-clip drive — the one nonlinearity in the whole signal path.
//!
//! Everything else here is linear. Oscillators sum, the SVF is two integrators,
//! the amp envelope is a multiply, delay and reverb are sums of delayed copies, and
//! the limiter only ever scales. A linear chain can make a sound brighter, darker,
//! longer or louder, but it can never put a frequency into the output that was not
//! in the input — and that is precisely the property an ear recognises as *digital*.
//! Every record anyone has called warm, glued or expensive went through tape, a
//! tube, a transistor stage or a plugin imitating one, and all four are the same
//! thing underneath: a transfer curve that bends as the signal gets loud.
//!
//! The curve is `tanh`, which is what most "tape" and "tube" boxes are at heart —
//! smooth, odd-symmetric (so it makes odd harmonics, the musical ones), and with no
//! corner for a peak to catch on. One curve, deliberately: a second character is an
//! argument to have once a real recipe cannot be made with this one.
//!
//! ## Why `drive` is not a volume knob
//!
//! `tanh(drive · x)` on its own is quieter than `x` for a signal already near full
//! scale and louder for a quiet one, so turning it up would re-balance the mix and
//! every recipe using it would have to compensate by hand. Dividing by `tanh(drive)`
//! normalises the curve to pass through `(1, 1)`: a full-scale input comes back
//! full-scale at **every** drive, so `drive` changes the *shape* of the waveform and
//! not its peak. It has the two properties that matter at the ends, too — as `drive`
//! falls to zero the curve tends to the identity line, and it asymptotes at
//! `1/tanh(drive)` (1.04 at drive 2, 1.00 at drive 4), so anything hotter than full
//! scale comes back to about full scale. That is peaks handled gently *before* the
//! limiter has to act on them rather than after.
//!
//! That is peak-referenced, which is the right reference here because every place a
//! chain can live — a note, a track bus, the master sum — is upstream of the limiter
//! and sits near full scale by construction. What it does not promise is constant
//! *loudness*: a squarer wave of the same peak carries more energy, and that added
//! weight is the effect working rather than a level error.
//!
//! ## Aliasing, and the drive that stays clean
//!
//! A nonlinearity invents harmonics, and any harmonic landing above Nyquist folds
//! back down as an inharmonic tone — the same failure polyBLEP saves the naive saw
//! from, and one no waveshaper running at the output rate can avoid. `tanh` is soft
//! enough that its harmonics fall away fast, so what actually decides the damage is
//! how bright the *source* is, far more than how hard it is driven. Measured as
//! total folded energy against the fundamental, for a full-scale sine:
//!
//! | source | drive 1 | drive 2 | drive 4 | drive 8 |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | 1 kHz | < −140 dB | −141 dB | −78 dB | −45 dB |
//! | 3 kHz | −88 dB | −53 dB | −31 dB | −21 dB |
//! | 5 kHz | −45 dB | −28 dB | −18 dB | −13 dB |
//!
//! So: on a bass, a drum, a pad or a whole mix — anything with its energy under a
//! couple of kHz — drive up to 4 is inaudibly clean. On a bright lead the honest
//! range is 1 to 2, and past that it will ring inharmonically. Running the shaper
//! 2× oversampled would buy 50–60 dB of that back, and is the exit if a recipe ever
//! genuinely needs a hard drive on a bright source; it is not done here because the
//! interpolation and decimation filters it needs are memory, and being memoryless is
//! what lets this effect claim a tail of exactly zero.
