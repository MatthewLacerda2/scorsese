//! the peak limiter every bake passes through.
//!
//! Not an effect a recipe chooses: a bake **must never clip**. Detuned oscillators
//! drift in and out of phase, a resonant filter can double a peak, and summed notes
//! add up — any of which can push a buffer past ±1, where 16-bit quantization turns
//! the overshoot into a click. So the last thing a bake does is limit.
//!
//! **The peak it is held to is the *true* peak**, not the loudest sample. A sample
//! is a point on a band-limited curve, and the curve between two samples routinely
//! exceeds both of them — so a buffer whose every sample sat under the old ceiling
//! of 0.98 could still pass full scale the moment a converter, `scorsese-render`'s
//! resampler or a delivery codec reconstructed it. That is not a tolerance quibble:
//! it is a promise this module made and did not keep, on files
//! [`crate::level::meter`] was already reporting as clipping. The required gain is
//! therefore computed from [`crate::level::intersample`] — the same reconstruction
//! the meter measures with, so the guarantee and the report cannot drift apart
//! again.
//!
//! Because we render offline we can do this properly, with **lookahead**: compute
//! the gain each sample needs, then walk the track backwards so the gain is already
//! down *before* a peak arrives (a short attack ramp instead of an instant duck),
//! and forwards so it recovers no faster than the release. Both passes only ever
//! lower the gain, so the ceiling is guaranteed, and a signal that never approaches
//! it is left untouched.
//!
//! **The two channels are linked**, which is the one thing a stereo limiter has
//! to get right. There is a single gain track, computed from whichever side is
//! louder at each sample and applied to both. Limiting each channel on its own
//! would be a fader that moved one side and not the other every time a peak
//! landed off-centre — a centred vocal would drift left whenever the hats on
//! the right got loud, and the whole image would breathe sideways. Linking
//! costs a `max`; not linking costs the stereo image, and a peak on one side
//! genuinely *is* a moment when the mix is too loud.
