//! Two channels, kept in two buffers.
//!
//! The shape every stage of the signal path works in once a source has
//! produced something. Left and right are always the same length, and every
//! operation here preserves that — a signal whose channels disagree about how
//! long it is has no meaning, and there is nowhere in this crate one could
//! legitimately arise.
//!
//! **Why split rather than interleaved** is argued in [the crate doc](crate);
//! the short of it is that nearly every function in this crate takes
//! `&mut [f32]`, and this shape lets them go on doing that.
//!
//! [`Stereo::each`] is the workhorse: it hands one channel at a time to a
//! function that has never heard of the other, which is what a filter, an
//! envelope, a waveshaper and a delay line all are. The stages that genuinely
//! need both sides at once — the linked limiter, the stereo reverb's mono
//! send, the pan that puts a mono part somewhere — reach for `l` and `r`
//! directly, and there are few enough of them to name.
//!
//! **Interleaving happens exactly twice**, at the two edges where a buffer
//! stops being a signal and becomes something else: the WAV encoder, and the
//! meter. Both want the whole thing at once, so neither pays for the strided
//! access an interleaved signal path would have imposed on everything between
//! them.
