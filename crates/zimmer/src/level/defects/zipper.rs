//! Stepped gain: a level that moves in flat steps at a regular period instead
//! of smoothly.
//!
//! **Folded, not followed.** A step of half a decibel is smaller than the
//! ripple a note's own waveform puts into any window short enough to resolve
//! a 60 Hz step, so steps are not looked for one at a time. Instead a stretch
//! is cut into segments at a candidate period and phase, and two things are
//! averaged over every segment: the change *across* each boundary (the second
//! half of one segment to the first half of the next) and the change *within*
//! each segment (its first half to its second). A staircase changes only
//! across; a smooth fade changes as much within as across; a note's pulse,
//! read at its own period, swings within as far as it swings back across; and
//! noise changes at random, which averages away. So a staircase is a stretch
//! where across is consistently one way, clear of the noise, and within is
//! near nothing.
//!
//! The candidates come from where the block-to-block steps repeat
//! ([`candidates`]), and each is refined to a twentieth of a block, because
//! a 60 Hz period is 33⅓ blocks and a whole-block error drifts a third of a
//! segment off in ten steps.
