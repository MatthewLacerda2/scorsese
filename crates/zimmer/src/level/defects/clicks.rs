//! A click: one sample-to-sample jump far larger than every other jump around
//! it.
//!
//! **Every other jump, not the typical one.** A sawtooth jumps by its whole
//! height once a period, a drum's attack is a run of large jumps, and noise is
//! nothing but jumps; none of them clicks. What clicks is a jump that stands
//! alone — a sample-accurate cut in a tone, a buffer spliced at the wrong
//! place — so a jump is measured against the *largest* jump in the
//! [`REACH`] either side of it, which a regular waveform always has a twin of
//! and a click never does. Two samples either side are left out, so an
//! impulse (up then straight back down) is not its own twin.
//!
//! **Another click is not a twin.** A jump that itself stands out from the
//! jumps beside it counts as a neighbour only when the waveform either side
//! of it matches this one's — a sawtooth's next reset does, sample for
//! sample — so two clicks 10 ms apart, or a splice at every audio buffer,
//! each landing at a different point of the waveform, are each a click.
