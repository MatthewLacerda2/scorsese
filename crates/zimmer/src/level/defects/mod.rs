//! Defects that live between samples: clicks, dropouts and stepped gain, each
//! at a moment.
//!
//! Level, bands and the per-section profile describe how a sound *sits*; none
//! of them can tell a clean fade from a staircase of gain steps, or find a
//! 10 ms gap inside a one-second section, because both average away inside
//! any window long enough to measure loudness over. These are the defects a
//! listener calls "choppy" or "crackly", and they are found here by shape:
//!
//! - **A click** is one sample-to-sample jump far larger than any other jump
//!   around it ([`clicks`]). *Any other jump*, not the average one: a sawtooth
//!   jumps every period and is not clicking, and noise is nothing but jumps.
//! - **A dropout** is a short run of near-silence inside sound that is going
//!   on either side of it ([`envelope`]). Short is the point: a pause between
//!   sentences is longer than any dropout.
//! - **Stepped gain** ("zipper") is a level that moves in flat steps at a
//!   regular period — a gain set once per game frame and held — instead of
//!   smoothly, reported with the period found ([`envelope`]).
//!
//! **A signal, never a gate**, like the rest of `level`: a hard cut in an edit
//! is a click on purpose, and a gated drum is a dropout on purpose. What this
//! changes is that "it sounds choppy" becomes a time, a channel and a number
//! that a fix can be measured against.
//!
//! **Fed a run at a time** and never holding the signal: the click search
//! keeps a window of 50 ms per channel, and the other two keep one energy per
//! half millisecond, which is a two-thousandth of the samples.
