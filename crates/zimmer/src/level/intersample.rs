//! A sample is not the signal — it is a point on a band-limited curve, and the
//! curve between two samples can exceed both of them. So a buffer whose every
//! sample sits under full scale can still clip the moment anything reconstructs
//! it: a converter on the way to a speaker, a resampler on the way into a mix,
//! an AAC encoder on the way into a delivered video. All three are on paths
//! this workspace already puts audio through.
//!
//! **One copy of the arithmetic, read by two callers, and that is the whole
//! reason it is a module.** [`super::meter`] reports the true peak; the
//! [limiter](crate::fx::limiter) holds a bake under it. When they reconstructed
//! the waveform differently the limiter could satisfy its own guarantee and be
//! reported as clipping by the meter that shipped beside it — which is exactly
//! what happened, and is a class of bug no amount of care in either file would
//! have caught. Sharing the kernel makes the two agree by construction; all
//! that is left to choose is the number each holds against.
