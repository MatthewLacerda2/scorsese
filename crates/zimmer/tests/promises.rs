//! The two claims the rest of scorsese is built on: a bake is **deterministic**,
//! and a note comes out at the **pitch it was asked for**.
//!
//! Everything else here is a detail of how a sound is made. These two are the
//! contract: `generated/` addresses a bake by the hash of its recipe, which is
//! only sound if the same recipe really does produce the same bytes.
