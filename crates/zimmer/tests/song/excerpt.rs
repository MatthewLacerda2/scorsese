//! Rendering less of a song: a window, and a solo.
//!
//! The property the whole feature stands on is here: **a window is the whole
//! bake, cut**. Sample for sample, not to within a tolerance — a mix decision
//! taken on eight bars is only worth taking if those eight bars are the ones
//! the file will have. So the songs below carry the stages that could break
//! it: a compressor keyed off another track and one on the sum, both of which
//! look ahead, a reverb that decays across the window's edges, a `fit` that
//! changes how many times the arrangement plays, and a fade at the end.
