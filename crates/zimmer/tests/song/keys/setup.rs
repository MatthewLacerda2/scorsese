//! What every key test is written against: one instrument, one pattern, and
//! the shorthands for putting a degree or a triad into it.
//!
//! The instrument is a **plucked string** on purpose. It is pitched, so a
//! degree that resolves to the wrong note fails rather than passing silently,
//! and it is stochastic, so byte-equality between two renders also says the
//! entries took the same ordinals — and therefore the same seeds — as each
//! other. A noise patch would prove the second and none of the first.
