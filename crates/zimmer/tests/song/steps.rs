//! A step string as one entry, held to the notes it replaced.
//!
//! The claim the notation lives or dies by: **writing a rhythm as a string must
//! equal writing its hits out by hand** — the same onsets, the same velocities,
//! the same ordinals, and therefore the same performance on top of them. If it
//! does not, the shorthand has stopped meaning the long form and a document
//! that reads as `x-xX` is playing something else.
