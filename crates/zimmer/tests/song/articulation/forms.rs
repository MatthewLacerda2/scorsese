//! A mark survives every way an entry can be written, and the document says so.
//!
//! A chord's voices, a step string's hits and a degree all become ordinary
//! notes before the mixer sees one, so the failure this file exists to catch is
//! silent: an expansion that forgets to carry the field renders a perfectly
//! good note that simply is not the one the page marked.
