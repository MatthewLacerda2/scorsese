//! What every articulation test is written against.
//!
//! The instrument is a **saw through a low-pass a hard strike opens**, held
//! flat and released instantly. That makes all three of the things a mark
//! moves measurable from the samples themselves: velocity is the peak level,
//! the velocity-to-brightness routing is the tone, and the gate is exactly how
//! long the note sounds. Asserting what a mark *did* rather than that a field
//! parsed is the whole point of the file.
