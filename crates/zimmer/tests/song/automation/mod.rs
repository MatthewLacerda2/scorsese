//! out: the value at a given beat is the one the curve says, each easing bends
//! a segment its own way, a beat outside the written span clamps rather than
//! extrapolating, and a curve parked at the number a track was already written
//! at renders the identical samples. A suite that only asked whether a build
//! got louder somewhere would pass on a curve read backwards, at the wrong
//! tempo, or half as fast.
