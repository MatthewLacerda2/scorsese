//! How long a baked one-shot's file is (#970): as long as the sound, not as
//! long as the renderer's worst-case allowance for its release and effects.
//!
//! The pop below is the shape that reported it: a tenth of a second of sine
//! falling onto its pitch, through a small room. Its raw render is sized for
//! the room's longest ring and runs past 1.2 s.
