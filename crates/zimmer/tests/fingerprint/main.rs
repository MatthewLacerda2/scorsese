//! The sound did not move unless `SYNTH_VERSION` did (#1216).
//!
//! A change to what a recipe renders to needs a [`SYNTH_VERSION`] bump, or
//! every project that baked the recipe keeps audio it no longer describes,
//! silently — and rusty with them. Determinism within one build
//! (`promises.rs`) cannot see that; this can. A small probe corpus
//! (`probes.rs`) is baked, and each bake measured: its length, its level, and
//! where its energy sits. The measures are recorded in `table.rs` beside the
//! version they were taken at.
//!
//! - **Measures moved, version did not**: the sound changed, so bump the
//!   version (its table, and `SYNTH_VERSION.md`) and re-record.
//! - **Version moved**: re-recording is expected, and asked for.
//!
//! **Measures, with tolerance, never a digest.** The constant's own doc
//! explains why a digest cannot work: `sin`, `exp` and `powf` are not
//! bit-identical between platforms. A length, a level and three band shares
//! carry a tolerance a platform's last bit cannot reach and a sound change
//! does.
//!
//! **Every platform runs it**, unlike the golden renders: those compare
//! frames an encoder and a font rasteriser shaped, these compare sums over a
//! whole 16-bit file, where libm's last-bit drift averages away. CI's x86_64
//! Linux records the table and is the authority if a platform ever disagrees;
//! widening a tolerance for one is where that would be said.
//!
//! **What it is sized to catch**: lowering the limiter's ceiling by a tenth of
//! a decibel moves two rows, and a pluck's delay line one sample shorter moves
//! its row. What it cannot see is a change no measure here reaches — a pitch
//! moved by well under a percent, a stereo image swapped — so a branch that
//! touches rendering maths still checks its own diff (`SYNTH_VERSION.md`).
