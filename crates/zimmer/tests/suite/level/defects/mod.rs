//! Defects that live between samples: clicks, dropouts and stepped gain.
//!
//! Every signal here is built so the answer is known by construction — a jump
//! put at a named sample, a gap of a named length, a gain changed once every
//! 800 samples — and every clean signal is one a careless detector would flag:
//! a sawtooth is a jump every period, a low tone ripples, a smooth fade moves
//! the level all the time, and noise is nothing but jumps.
