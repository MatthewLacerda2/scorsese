//! What a document writes back: the keys a round trip adds, held to none.
//!
//! The address of a bake hashes the recipe's **bytes**, and tools re-serialise
//! a recipe whenever they write one. So an optional field that writes its
//! default into every document changes every recipe's bytes, and every cached
//! bake misses, without a sample moving (`crates/zimmer/CLAUDE.md`). Each such
//! field takes `skip_serializing_if`, and [`drift`] holds every one of them
//! at once — including the next one, which is the point.
//!
//! Shared by path with `crates/providers/tests/documented`, which holds the
//! worked recipes in `docs/recipes.md` to the same, so the list of fields that
//! predate the rule is written once.
