# `project.json` — schema v3

The contract between the CLI, the MCP server, the GUI, and every project
saved on someone's disk. It is meant to be hand-written: an agent should be
able to author a whole video in this file and render it without touching a
mouse.

Changing this format is `architecture` work — it needs a `schema_version`
bump and a migration note.

## The document

```json
{
  "schema_version": 3,
  "name": "Narrated teaser",
  "timeline_fps": { "num": 30, "den": 1 },
  "assets": [ ... ],
  "tracks": [ ... ]
}
```

`assets` and `tracks` may be omitted; both default to empty. `timeline_fps`
may **not** — see below. Every other field shown below as optional may be
omitted, and omitted is written as *absent*, never as `null`. Unknown fields
are an error, not a warning — a typo like `"trackz"` fails the load rather
than being silently dropped.

## Assets

An asset is an entity. Clips point at assets **by id, never by path**, so
re-importing or regenerating a file is one edit in one place.

| Field | Required for | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | all | Unique within the project |
| `kind` | all | `video`, `image`, `audio`, `text`, `generated_video`, `generated_audio` |
| `path` | file-backed kinds | Relative to the project root |
| `sha256` | optional | 64 lowercase hex chars, of the file at `path` |
| `media` | optional | What ffprobe found: `duration_seconds`, `width`, `height`, `frame_rate` (a rational), `audio_channels`, `sample_rate` |
| `prompt` | `generated_*` | What to generate |
| `state` | `generated_*` | `sketch`, `queued`, `generated`, `stale` |
| `text` | `text` | The string to render; text assets carry content inline and have no `path` |

```json
{ "id": "shot-city", "kind": "generated_video", "state": "sketch",
  "prompt": "wide aerial of a city at dawn, slow push in" }
```

A `generated_*` asset in `sketch` or `stale` has no media yet and renders as
a slug card — the prompt on a gray card. That is what makes previewing a full
cut cost nothing. `GO` generates exactly the sketch and stale assets;
`generated` is a cache hit and is never re-billed.

`media.duration_seconds` is wall-clock, and `media.frame_rate` is a rational
in the same shape as `timeline_fps` — a source's own grid, which is not
necessarily the timeline's.

## The timeline framerate

```json
"timeline_fps": { "num": 30000, "den": 1001 }
```

The grid this edit is authored against. Every clip and keyframe time in the
document is a whole frame count on it.

**Rational, not a float.** 29.97 is exactly 30000/1001; 23.976 is 24000/1001.
A float cannot hold either, and rounding them is where long-timeline drift
comes from. `{ "num": 30, "den": 1 }` is plain 30. The fraction is reduced on
load, so `60/2` and `30/1` are the same value.

**Required, with no default.** A missing framerate would leave every time in
the file meaning something other than what its author intended, so a document
without one does not load. Both parts must be non-zero.

**Chosen at project creation** — `scorsese new teaser.scor --fps 30000/1001`,
defaulting to 30. Changing it afterwards is a real operation — rescale the
edit, or reinterpret it at the new rate? — not a field edit. Nothing here
forecloses it; it is simply not something you do by hand.

`--fps` takes `30` or `30000/1001` and refuses `29.97`, for the same reason
the field is a fraction.

### Timeline fps is not output fps

Render settings — resolution, fps, bitrate — are still chosen per render.
(Aspect ratio is not a setting of its own: it is whatever the resolution says,
and how a source of another shape meets it is the clip's `fit`, below.) The
two are different questions:

- the **timeline** framerate answers *what is on screen when*, and
- the **output** framerate is what the file you deliver is encoded at.

A render at a rate other than the timeline's **conforms** from the grid; the
grid stays authoritative.

### Conforming: source fps ≠ timeline fps

A source shot at another rate — a 24fps clip on a 30fps timeline — is
conformed by taking, for each timeline frame, the **nearest source frame in
wall-clock time**. No interpolation, no invented in-between frames: 24→30
repeats source frames in the familiar 2:3 pattern. Optical-flow retiming is a
feature someone can ask for later, not a silent default.

The same rule, in the same direction, covers rendering at an output rate
other than the timeline's.

## Tracks and clips

```json
{
  "id": "v1", "kind": "video", "name": "Main",
  "clips": [
    { "id": "c-shot", "asset": "shot-city", "start": 0, "duration": 240 }
  ]
}
```

A track is `video` or `audio`. Video tracks composite in array order, first
at the bottom; audio tracks all mix together. Visual assets go on video
tracks, audible ones on audio tracks.

**Order means nothing on audio tracks.** Sounds playing at once are summed,
and addition does not care which came first — there is no "on top" for a
music bed. A clip is heard because it is somewhere, not because of where its
track sits in the list.

**A video clip's own sound is mixed too.** Every camera clip has sound on it,
and a clip on a *video* track whose file carries an audio stream is mixed
alongside the audio tracks, at the same keyframed `volume` as anything else —
so muting a talking head under a voiceover is `volume: 0.0` on that clip. No
new field, no second concept, and no demuxing a file by hand to line its own
sound back up against its picture.

Whether a file has an audio stream is read from the asset's
`media.audio_channels`. An asset nobody has probed is **not** assumed to be
silent: a render probes what the project never recorded before it plans
anything, and if that probe fails, the clip is mixed without its own sound and
the report says which clip and why. Silence is never something a render
decided on its own without mentioning it.

A **hole in a track contributes nothing**, so the tracks below it show through.
Only a stretch with nothing on *any* video track renders black. That is the
difference between an empty patch of an overlay track and an empty timeline.

### How a source is fitted into the raster

A clip chooses this with `fit`, which is `fit` when absent:

| `fit` | what happens | for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fit` | scaled to sit **inside** the raster, keeping proportions; the leftover is **transparent** | the default — the whole shot, bars allowed |
| `fill` | scaled to **cover** the raster, keeping proportions; the overflow is cropped off the edges | a background plate that must not have bars |
| `native` | not scaled at all; the source arrives at its **own pixel size**, resting centred | a logo or badge at the size it was authored |

```json
{ "id": "c-logo", "asset": "logo", "start": 0, "duration": 60, "fit": "native" }
```

The leftover under `fit` is transparent rather than black. On the bottom track
the distinction is invisible, since the canvas beneath is black anyway. On an
upper track it is the whole point: a 4:3 clip over a 16:9 one shows the wider
clip at the sides rather than blacking it out. The same goes for the canvas
around a `native` layer — the tracks below show through it.

**Why `native` exists.** Under `fit`, a 64×64 logo in a 1920×1080 render
arrives 1080×1080 and has to be shrunk back with `transform.scale.x: 0.06`.
That number means nothing to a reader, it stops being right the moment the
render's resolution changes, and working it out means arithmetic against a
raster the project is not supposed to know about. `native` says "the logo, at
its size, moved here", which is what the author meant.

`native` rests the source **centred**, and `transform.position.*` offsets from
there. Centred, because the alternative — a corner — is an arbitrary edge of
that same raster. A source an odd number of pixels smaller than the raster
cannot sit exactly in the middle of it and is rounded to a whole pixel, since
half a pixel out would soften every edge in the layer. A source **larger** than
the raster is clipped by it rather than being shrunk: native means native.

`fit` is picture only. An audio clip has no raster, and a `fit` on one is
meaningless rather than invalid. Anchors other than the centre, per-clip crop
rectangles, and stretch-to-fill are not here: the last one is what
`transform.scale.*` already does for anyone who truly wants it.

A clip carries `start` and `duration` on the timeline, an optional
`source_in` offset into the media (default `0`), an optional `fit`
(default `fit`), and optional `keyframes`.
`source_in` counts in **timeline** frames too — "skip the first two seconds"
means the same thing whatever the source was shot at, and the conform rule
below turns it into a source frame.

**Times are whole frames on `timeline_fps`, not seconds.** At 30fps the clip
above runs frames 0–239 and covers the first eight seconds. A fractional or
negative time is not a time: it fails the load rather than being rounded into
place.

Clips on one track may *touch* but never overlap, and with integer frames that
is a fact rather than a tolerance. A clip ending at frame 240 and one starting
at 240 do not overlap: frame 240 belongs to the second, and nothing has to
arbitrate a cut at `1.0333333`.

A gap is allowed, and renders **black** for its length — or, on an audio
track, **silence**. Leaving a hole is a way of saying "two seconds of nothing
here", not a way of shortening the timeline. A timeline ends where its last
clip ends.

### How long a render is

**Picture decides.** A render's length is where the last video clip ends;
audio carrying on past it is cut there and reported. The thing being produced
is a video, and an edit ends when the last thing you can see ends — a music
bed left long is a bed left long, not a request for a longer film.

The other way round is simply silence: audio shorter than the picture leaves
the rest of the soundtrack empty, and the file still carries a sound stream.
A project with no audio clips at all is different again — that file has **no
audio stream**, which is not the same as a stream of silence.

Sample rate and audio bitrate are chosen per render, like resolution and
framerate, and default to 48 kHz. Sources of any rate are resampled on the way
in, so the mix only ever works in one.

## Keyframes

```json
"keyframes": [
  { "property": "opacity", "keyframes": [
      { "t": 0, "value": 0.0, "easing": "ease_in" },
      { "t": 15, "value": 1.0 }
  ]}
]
```

A keyframe track is `(property_path, [(t, value, easing)])` over any numeric
property. `t` is in frames relative to the **start of the clip**, so moving a
clip never rewrites its keyframes. Times must ascend strictly.

Frames are enough resolution even for audio. Keyframes are *control points*
and the value travels continuously between them, so putting the points on the
frame grid does not make a ramp steppy — it only quantises where the ramp's
corners sit, to 1/30s, which is well below audible for a fade. `easing` is
`linear` (default), `ease_in`, `ease_out`, `ease_in_out`, or `hold`.

`property` is a dotted string — `opacity`, `transform.position.x`, `volume`
— and core does **not** check that it names a property that exists. That is
the generality rule: core defines property types, never property values. The
compositor resolves paths; adding a new animatable property costs nothing
here.

### What the compositor animates today

| path | means | `1.0` / `0.0` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opacity` | how solid the layer is | `1.0` solid, `0.0` invisible |
| `transform.position.x` | offset right, in **output pixels** | `0.0` unmoved |
| `transform.position.y` | offset down, in output pixels | `0.0` unmoved |
| `transform.scale.x` | width multiplier about the layer's centre | `1.0` natural size |
| `transform.scale.y` | height multiplier about the layer's centre | `1.0` natural size |
| `volume` | how loud a clip plays, on either kind of track | `1.0` as recorded, `0.0` silent |

Scale is **centre-anchored**, so shrinking a clip does not also slide it into a
corner. Position is applied after scale and measured in output pixels, so it
means the same thing whatever the source was shot at.

`volume` applies to any clip that makes a sound, which includes a clip on a
video track whose file has audio on it. It is a multiplier, so above `1.0` is
gain and below zero is nothing —
a negative multiplier is a phase inversion, which is not what dragging a
volume line past the floor means, so it is clamped away. **Muting a clip is
`volume` `0.0`**, not a flag: one keyframe holds for the whole clip, and the
thing that makes a clip silent is the same thing that fades it out.

Volume is evaluated **per sample**, travelling continuously between keyframes
rather than stepping once a frame — thirty steps a second is inaudible as
pitch but audible as a zipper. That is why frames are enough resolution for an
audio fade: they place the corners of the ramp, not the ramp itself.

A path nothing animates is **ignored** — not an error. A project authored
against a newer scorsese has to still render on an older one, so an unknown
property can never fail a render.

It is **warned** about, though, because the cost of ignoring it silently is
that a typo like `opactiy` does nothing at all: the keyframe track is valid,
the render succeeds, and the fade simply never happens. `scorsese check` and
every render's report name the clip and the property, and suggest the property
it was probably meant to be when there is an obvious candidate:

```
warning: clip `c1`: nothing animates `opactiy` — did you mean `opacity`?
```

A warning is all it is. It never fails a render, a check, or a merge — it
audits quality rather than proving correctness, and a hard error would make
every newly animatable property a breaking change for projects that already
use it. The list of what *is* animatable lives in the crate that implements
each property — the compositor for the visual ones, the mixer for `volume` —
so it cannot drift from the code, and core still knows nothing about which
properties exist.

Because `t` counts from the clip's start, a fade written once keeps working
after the clip is dragged elsewhere on the timeline. `scorsese-compositor`'s
`fade_in` and `fade_out` are sugar that write exactly these opacity keyframes
— there is no separate fade mechanism, which is why a fade composes with a
move or a zoom for free.

## Paths

Every path is relative to the project root and uses forward slashes on every
platform. Absolute paths (`/media/x.mp4`, `C:/media/x.mp4`, `\\host\share`),
backslashes, and `..` components are all rejected. This is what lets a
project survive `scp -r` between machines.

## Validation

`Project::load` validates; `Project::save` does not, so an editor may save
work that is mid-edit and temporarily incoherent. Validation reports **every**
problem in one pass rather than stopping at the first, so an agent repairing
a project unattended sees the whole list at once.

What it checks: schema version, duplicate ids, path rules, hash shape, the
fields each asset kind requires, clip references resolving, asset kind
against track kind, non-zero durations, clip overlap, and keyframe shape.

Note what is *not* on that list. A time that is negative, fractional, or
infinite cannot be represented as a frame count, so it fails the parse with
the line it is on — earlier and more precisely than validation could say it.
The same goes for an unusable `timeline_fps`: there is nothing useful to
validate about a timeline whose grid is undefined.

## Migrating from v2

v3 adds one optional field: `fit` on a clip. **Absent means `fit`**, which is
what every clip did before the field existed, so no v2 document means anything
different under v3 — converting one is changing `"schema_version": 2` to
`"schema_version": 3` and nothing else.

The version still has to be changed by hand, because this build reads exactly
one schema version and refuses the rest. That refusal is the point: a document
that says `2` was written against a build that could not have meant anything by
`fit`, and inferring which of the two a file in front of us is would be
guessing rather than reading.

## Migrating from v1

v1 measured the timeline in float seconds and had no `timeline_fps`. It was
never shipped and no v1 project is known to exist, so **v2 ships no migration
code**: a v1 document is refused with "this build reads schema_version 2".

Converting one by hand, if one ever turns up, is two steps: pick the
framerate the edit was authored against and add it as `timeline_fps`, then
multiply every `start`, `duration`, `source_in`, and keyframe `t` by that rate
and round to the nearest whole frame. Rounding is the reason this is a manual
decision rather than an automatic one — it can move a cut by a frame, and only
the person who made the cut can say whether that matters.

A complete worked example lives in
`crates/core/tests/fixtures/narrated_teaser.json`.
